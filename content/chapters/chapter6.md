Carter Bertram Holland looked at his partner, Sonny Pera. Sonny was everything that Holland was not. They were of similar builds, but that was the extent of the likeness. Sonny had a nervous energy and was prone to constant fidgeting. He was impulsive and sloppy, but he was white. His family had deep ties to the agency, which explained how he had managed to squeak by.

Sonny was out at the end of the drive waving the sheriff onto the dirt road. He motioned the car toward the barn where Holland was waiting. Holland pulled open the doors and stepped aside. The sheriff met his gaze on the way into the barn, eyes narrowed.

Holland stepped out to cut off Sonny as he made his way back, "No, go around to loft and use the parabolic mic, I want this on file." When he was sure that the other man was out of sight he returned to the interior of the barn.

"Sheriff Smith, thank you for coming." Holland walked past him to the far side of the barn where a cheap plastic folding table and chairs were waiting. "Come have a seat, please." He waited for the sheriff to sit down, noting with pleasure that the big man looked uncomfortable on the undersized seat. He stopped to pick up a slim black attache case before seating himself on the opposite side.

With practiced casual movements, Holland opened the case and removed a single manila folder. Placing the folder on the table unopened he asked, "what did you find out?"

The sheriff looked around, his face tight as he took in the barn. Holland waited. He was very good at waiting. He let his lids fall, a three-quarters open stare. Then with learned expertise, silenced everything except the sheriff and waited.
"Um," the man started and stopped to look over his shoulder again. "Where's Agent Pera?"

"He is elsewhere. What did you find out sheriff?"

"Phbhh," the sheriff blew. "You've got this hospitality thing down," he said with a grin. "I might have to borrow the setup sometime."

To all but the most tenacious observer, Holland didn't so much as breathe when he was still. He waited.

"Right," Smith continued lowering his voice into a rolling basso. "You were right about the Avery's, but it wasn't Danny. His grandson is visiting from Portland. I think it was the boy. Probably just out enjoying a little off-road fun. They didn't seem to know anything else."

"I did not ask for your assessment sheriff. What is the grandson's name?"

"Nickolas."

"His full name."

"You told me to act natural, I couldn't think of a reason to ask."

"Very well, his description then."

"Male, caucasian, between six-one and six-two, slim. I say 180 tops. Dark hair, dark eyes about 17 or so."

"Did you get photos of the tires?"

"No, the boy had the ATV with him and they keep it in the garage now. But I did get a few pictures of the tread in fresh snow right outside the garage. The kid's footprints are there too."

"May I have them?"

"Didn't have a chance to develop them," he reported as he withdrew the film canister. "Used the whole roll, about halfway through I remembered to toss down my cuffs for reference."

Holland took the plastic cylinder, "thank you, sheriff. You may leave now."

Smith stood and took two steps toward the truck then stopped. "What do want with the Averys?" There was grit to the question that made Holland pause.
"Like I said, it is a matter of national security."

"Don't give me that crap!" Holland kept his back turned. Even when he heard Smith take a step closer he didn't turn around. "I have been told to cooperate with you. Still don't have a clue about where you're from or what in the hell this is all about."

Holland opened the file in front of him, "You may leave now, sheriff."

"Asshole," Smith shot back as he returned to his truck and left.

Sunny crawled down the ladder a minute later. "You are one chill brotha," he quipped as he flopped down into the empty chair.

"Pera, I am not your brother, and you can call me Agent Holland, Holland, or if you are feeling informal you can call me sir."

"Holy shit! Did you just crack wise?" Sonny tilted the plastic chair back until the rear legs began to bend. "Anyway, sheriff Smith is all pearls and cheese on the surface. You know as good as me, he's a bad mutha underneath. Incognito like, ya dig."

"Pera," he waited before enunciating, "knock, it, off."

"Yeah, yeah, sorry. I was tryin to give you a compliment." The back legs of the chair seemed about to give way. Pera intuited the failure and leaned forward to a normal seated position. "C.W. Smith is not the kind of guy I would want to poke at like that. I was impressed."

"He was lying, or rather playing a game of keep-away with the truth." He tossed the black plastic canister to Sonny and packed the folder back into the case. "The real question is, do you think he managed to warn the Averys?"

"Everything I read about our sheriff? My bet is no, he's too by the book. Like a friendlier version of you."

"I concur with your impression but disagree with your conclusion Pera. The sheriff is by the book, to him, the rules are a tool he uses to do his job. But he does the job because he fashions himself the guardian of his community. He values his relationships over the institution."

"So whaduya wanna do?"

"I," he replied as he rose, "am going to surveil. You are going to go get that developed and find out who the kid is. I will turn on the car phone for ten minutes on the hour, every hour. Report in when you have something."

"So I have the rental then? Got it. You wanna pack up the table?"

"No, leave it for the property owner," Holland waved. He was getting back into the car when Sonny stopped him.

"Hey, Holland," he hollered. "Why do we care about the Averys? I mean we recovered the relic. Why does it matter if they saw it or whatever?"

"Pera, unlike sheriff Smith, I love the institution," he offered. The other man stood staring as Holland closed the door and drove away.
Holland had passed the Avery's driveway and was looking for a place to turn around. When a blue pickup truck appeared in the rearview. He sped up enough to seem natural but allow the truck to get closer. He could see two men in the cab, a grey-haired man in his 60's at the wheel, and a younger dark-haired passenger.

Holland frowned, he didn't like surprises. Picking up the car phone he dialed the hotel. "Griffen Creek Inn, this is Sandy, what can I do for you?"
"Room 221 please."

"Sure thing sweetie," the line rang again. Ten rings later he hung up and dialed again. "Griffen Creek Inn, this is Sandy, what can I do for you?"
"This is Carter Holland, I am staying in room 222 adjacent to Mr. Pera. I need you to deliver a message to him when he comes in."

"Oh, how are you? Yeah, Mr. Pera totally came through a little bit ago, you just missed him. What do you want me to tell him?"
"I need him to call me as soon as possible, it is very urgent."

"Oh, of course, of course. Call you, ASAP, got it. Say, is Mr. Pera single? He's soo nice, I could just melt. You know."
"Sandy," he crooned through gritted teeth. "you'll have to ask Mr. Pera, I am not at liberty to say."

"Oh okay, I mean yeah whatever. I was just curious cause there is this party later and..."

"Sandy, my apologies, I am in the middle of something and have to hang up now. Thanks for your help." He hung up and called logistics. The line rang twice then beeped. He punched a series of numbers onto the keypad and hung up.

30 seconds later the car phone rang. "Holland here. I need a most likely destination and a route to get there. I am forward lead on a person of interest. Avery, Danny."

"Location?" The voice was measured and calm as if reading the financial pages.

"Northbound approximately two miles from the Avery residence on Upper Applegate Road."

"Hold on." He could hear the crisp sound of the operator flipping through paper maps. " Got it. Medford city center is your likely. Mc Kee Bridge is next, keep north about three miles past it and look for Little Applegate Road on your right. What is your rate of travel?
"Road conditions are poor right now, I would say 30 to 35 miles per hour max."

The click-clack rapid-fire sound of a ten-key filled the line. "So your POI is most likely to enter Medford by way of Main ST eastbound from the Jacksonville highway. ETA is 41 minutes best time at the current rate." More clacking, "You need to average 44 miles per hour to meet them on Main ST at Lozier LN. Do you want the turn by turn details?"

"One moment," he pulled out his note pad and moved the phone to the other ear. "Proceed."

"Nine turns, 1R Little Applegate. 2L and 3L Sterling Creek. 4R Poormans Creek. 5L Griffin Creek. 6R Sunset Drive, 7R Thomas Road. 8L West Stewart, and 9L Lozier. You should have visibility of your rendezvous point from about 200 yards out."

"Nice work analyst. Logging off," He hung up the phone and looked in the rearview. The truck was still a few hundred feet back he noted with satisfaction.

The alternate route turned out to be a white knuckle drive. Keeping within the parameter for interception proved reckless. Luckily nobody was on the road. Still, when the carphone rang 20 minutes into the drive he ignored it, opting instead to keep his hands on the wheel.
Holland was sweating under his parka by the time he pulled onto Lozier LN. He checked his watch, 41:16 elapsed time. His mouth pulled downward as he scanned the distant intersection.

As the car pulled into the large parking lot of the Thunderbird Market, it was 44:01. He picked up the phone and dialed his callback code.

"Holland?" Sunny's voice answered.
"Yes, where are you?"

"In a private room at the public library, why?"

"Can you get to Main Street in a hurry?"

"I'm on Main Street. What do you need?"

"Danny Avery and his grandson may be on Main right now. I need you to intercept and follow. Blue Datsun 620 King Cab, go now!"

The phone went silent, Holland reset the timer on his watch and waited. He would wait ten minutes then follow the path logistics had forecast.
Within five minutes a heavy man in a blue parka was pulling his holster belt up as he approached Hollands car. Holland rolled down the window and turned to face the man.

Still fumbling with his belt he stopped a few feet from the window and placed a hand on his sidearm. "There aint no loiterin in the parking lot son, you're gonna haff-a move on."

Holland's jaw muscles popped and rippled in quick succession, but his voice was even and cool when he spoke. "I was getting my bearings, just put my map away. I am leaving." He waited for a response.

The man seemed pleased with himself, "best you do then." Holland started the engine and made for the Main Street side of the lot. He could see the man on his radio in the mirror and hoped that he wasn't calling the local police.

He proceeded into slow, but no slow enough to draw attention. While improbable, the possibility that Avery was still behind him somewhere couldn't be overlooked. Once he was in the city proper, the nice ordered street layout turned messy. Holland made his way to the public library and parked the car.
Out on the street, he received some sideways looks and a few open-mouthed stares. This was why Pera was useful. For all of his rough spots, Pera had a way of integrating with the common folk everywhere he went. It made him a good cover operative. He had the potential to be one of the deep cover greats if he could ever learn to curb his impulses.

He was approaching the interstate when he spotted the rental. Perra must have spotted him too, the horn did a staccato Be-Bup. Holland made his way down to the car and climbed into the passenger seat.

"Here," Pera pushed a pair of binoculars into his hands. "Up ahead in the Greyhound station. They're at the counter now."
Holland found them and watched for a moment. "The sheriff warned them," he muttered.

"Well, looks that way. Or the kid was set to get out of here today anyway. The kid is one Nickolas Starr, by the way. Get this, he's 14!" Pera giggled. "14, he said again.

"You know he must have seen it. Him or both of them." He lowered the binoculars. "What else did you learn?"

"About Starr? Oldest of two boys, below-average student. Both parents are in their thirties and both enrolled at PSU in Portland. The father, Jack, was an airman and is a bit of a wild card. A few minor arrests, no charges. Public nuisance, drunken disorderly. Our boy here got himself arrested last month for shoplifting. And the week before Thanksgiving a fight at school landed him a two-week suspension "

Pera rolled down the window and lit up a cigarette. Leaning towards the window he took a few drags. "There's more," he blew his smoke out the window with a grin. "Jane Starr wrote a check to cash at a diner in Grants Pass on November 30th."

Holland turned eyebrows raised. "Nice work, how much leading did you have to do to get that?"

"Not much actually, the analyst was good. So what if this kid touched it? Would that have triggered the anomaly?"

"I have no idea, did you put in a request for instruction?"

"No, didn't put together that last piece until I was waiting here for you."

"Stay on him until I get back or he gets on a bus. I'm calling it in." He handed Pera the binoculars and made his exit. Leaning in before closing the door he added, "give me the claim ticket. I will wait for the photos while I make the call."

Holland took the ticket and read the address. He backtracked to his spot by the library and slipped into the driver's seat. He reached into the back seat and pulled out the black attaché case. Setting it in his lap, he opened it with care. The folders went on the seat next to him and he pressed the false bottom until it clicked.

He removed a sealed manila envelope and broke it open. Holland read the contents, then read it again frowning. He leaned back in his seat and closed his eyes, daydreaming about somewhere warm. Somewhere full of other black faces that didn't show fear or contempt when they looked at him. He took a deep breath and blew it out feeling a little guilty.

He set his jaw, put the blank, calm face over his frustrations, and drove to the Fotomat. The clerk eyed him up and down several times before asking, "what happened to the other guy?"

"He is busy and I am getting the photos because I have the ticket."

The other man glared at him for the rest of their interaction. Making sure to take the money before setting the pictures on the counter. Holland took them and drove to the service station to get the car ready for the road.

With the car prepped he bought two deli sandwiches and headed back to the rental agency to meet Pera. An uncomfortable bubble of acid grew in his stomach. The gravity of what was coming next dominated his thoughts.

He parked on the corner to wait for Pera and opened the white and red envelope. He pulled out the photos and flipped through them several times, frown deepening. He was still examining them when the Tak-Tak-Tak of knuckles on glass startled him.

Pera pulled open the door and slid into the passenger's seat. "Portland. The bus is due at 11:50 tonight. What's the play boss?"

"The tires match, but the boots don't."

"What does that mean?"

"It means, that the boots were Avery's." Holland leaned his head back to stare at the ceiling.
"So then we have to bring him into the geeks?"

"I don't think so. What do you remember about what forensics said on-site?"

"There was only one series of usable boot prints?"

"And?"

"And," Pera's face screwed up as he reflected. "Shit! I don-know man."

"Forensic's said that there was evidence to suggest that the boot wearer was one of two people on the scene. The boot man used the side of his foot to kick dirt over the relic and then stomped it down."

"And?" Pera asked, his voice rising a few notes.

"Why would he use his foot?"

"Jesus Holland, I'm lost, just tell me what you're getting at."

"Pera you have to try, I told you this is an audition. Now cut the cute and focus."

He took a deep breath and looked out the window, "okay. Phhhhh." As the last of the air ran out he seemed to gather himself. "Two possibles, why would the boot man use his foot to bury the relic?" He repeated.

"Okay, the only thing I can come up with. If there were two of them, say Avery and Starr, and the boots are Avery's, then Starr handled it and set off the anomaly. Maybe something happed then that spooked Avery. So he covers it up without touching it himself."

"Pretty good, Pera, now tell me why that was so damn hard to get out of you?" Holland didn't wait for an answer, "but there's a problem with that. If they were both there, then they rode the ATV together and Starr isn't going to fit on that thing with Avery. Plus if they were both there at the same time it wouldn't make sense that Starr's prints would be gone."

"No," the older man continued, "Starr triggered it and told Avery who went back and buried it. We found the radiation signature from several thousand yards out Six Days after! If he was there right after he may have felt it."

"That vibes, but shouldn't we play it safe anyway?"

"Look, Sonny," he leveled, amused to see the surprise on Pera's face at hearing his first name. "I haven't told you everything and I can't right now. But trust me, there are some BIG players on the field pulling the strings. If we bring the old guy in we could be signing his death certificate."
"Haha he Hm uhm hm ha eh ahhh," Pera laughed wiping a tear. Holland waited head cocked and a brow lifted until Pera stopped. "Shit!" He said slamming his fist into the door. "What fuck Holland!"

"Get some rest, it's four hours to Portland. I want you to track this Jack Starr down when we get there. I will call in our cover in the morning." For once Pera was silent as Holland made his way to the interstate.
