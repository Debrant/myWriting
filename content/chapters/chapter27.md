Sonny’s heart was pushing against his lungs with every beat. It was hard to breathe, let alone force himself to knock on the door. The brass plaque on the door read; Dr. Cynthia Blackwell, and mocked everything Randal Senior stood for. With a swallow, he rapped his knuckles under the nameplate with a rapid-fire tot-tot-tot. There were plenty of reasons to hide his uncertainty. He smoothed his lapels and straightened the tie.

“Come in,” Dr. Blackwell called from the other side. With a smile on his face, Sonny pushed the door open and stepped inside the room. Dr. Blackwell’s office was actually two rooms. The first, on the other side  of the door, was where she did the bulk of her daily work. The focal  point was an enormous lacquered desk. Twin bookshelves lined the walls  to each side of an expansive Palladian window behind the desk. The  room’s only light spilled from the many frames of glass, bathing the  desk in sunlight while leaving the corner of the room in shadow.

Dr.  Blackwell hung up her phone as Sonny stepped into the room. A grin  touched her lips as their eyes met. “Companion Pera, this is unexpected.  What do you need?”

“Ascendant Blackwell, uh, I was hoping you could help me out with Dr. Farouk.”

“Is  something wrong with the doctor?” She had gone back to reading the file  on her desk as if she expected he had nothing important for her. Sonny  clamped his smile firmly in place and continued.

“Ah, no, he’s  fine, but I am having trouble getting meaningful cooperation from him. I  am making substantial progress with Nick, but Ahmed’s reluctance to  help has cost me days of progress already. I’m hoping you can get him to  shape up and lend a hand.”

She looked up at him, pursing her lips  for a moment before speaking. “I am aware of Dr. Farouk’s hesitation.  He has his reasons. I would say this is between you and him. Why should I  help you, Sonny?”

His collar felt tighter with the surge of  irritation. Why does she have to be so difficult? “Because I need his  full cooperation, his brain. I don’t want to be leading this, I’m doing  what I’m told. I don’t think I have to explain to you all how I might  not best for this role? If that’s not enough, consider it a favor.”

Her  thin penciled in eyebrows rose at that last comment. “Okay, Mr. Pera,  but I can tell you that Dr. Farouk believes that you and your family had  a hand in Holland’s death. He doesn’t buy the narrative and it might go  a little easier if I knew your side of things.”

This is what Aimee would want, and was easier than I thought it would.

“We  were driving back from New Orleans and I called ahead to Dr. Randall  Junior. He wanted me to go back to DC to retrieve something for them and  asked if I would call Homeland to have him meet Darren at the farm. I  called Holland he agreed and when we go to the farm, I took one of the  spare cars and went back to my place in DC.”

“What was the purpose of Holland traveling to the farm? Why didn’t Darren Horne just drive straight here?”

“My  instructions were to tell Holland that we both had other pressing  assignments and we needed him at the farm to pick up Jack Starr. The  Randal’s didn’t want you to have access to Jack,” he admitted in a leap  of faith. Everything down to his bones hurt.

“How does sending Holland to the farm keep me from having access to Jack?”

Sonny  could hear the blood rushing in his ears. He felt like he was running a  marathon, but he forced himself to come clean. “It was an ambush Horne  didn’t even have Jack. Randall Junior told me to kill Jack before we got  there, but I couldn’t do it. Jack is safe. Horne didn’t know that, of  course, he still doesn’t.”

He waited. Now that he’d said it out  loud, he realized he had no way to prove it without implicating Aimee.  He opened his eyes wider to fight off the stinging sensation.

“Sonny, why are you telling me this now?”

Amy’s  words came back to him, “because I’m tired, doctor. I’m tired of the  manipulation, tired of my family lies. They wanted me to kill my friend  over politics. I mean, we already have the rock and we have Nick, what’s  the point?”

“Where is Mr. Starr now, and how can you be sure that he is safe?”

“I’m  not comfortable telling you that yet. If this doesn’t go right or more  people I care about, not just Jack might get hurt.” He had expected her  to react poorly to being told no. Her look of appreciation left him  wondering what he missed.

“Thank you for telling me that. I can  respect your reservations, and I will straighten things out with Farouk  immediately. What will you do about Jack?”

The emotional  excitement of the last few minutes was making it difficult to remember  what he’d set out to accomplish here. “What you mean?”

“You called  Mr. Starr your friend. Sonny, you don’t abandon your friends. How are  you going to help him get back to his normal life if your family wants  him out of the picture?”

Why couldn’t he remember what he had to  do next? It was all Nick’s fault the kid was a… It came back to him in a  flash. “I don’t know I was so concerned over what I’ve seen from his  son I barely had time to focus on what I should do with Jack.”

“Is something going wrong with the research? What concerns you about Nick?”

“What  doesn’t? Aside from the fact that he literally kicked my ass? He seems  to know as much about the fields of physics and biochemistry as  Christian and Ahmed combined, is unflappable, like he knows exactly what  you’re going to say before you say it. He gives me the creeps. But it’s  not really him the idea that it might stem from his contact with the  relic.”

“That’s an odd thing to say. Considering that belief in  the relic is exactly what got us all here in the first place. So  wouldn’t it seem like those would all be things you wanted to discover  or prove?”

“You might think so, but the thought of all that power  in Randall Senior’s hands scares me more than anything I’ve ever  imagined.”

The two of them sat staring at each other for a long  moment until Blackwell finally responded. “That thought scares me also,  but I’m interested to hear why you think the relic might be  responsible?”

“Well to start with there is the whole reliving any  moment of your life thing. Or the fact that it seems like no time passes  while you’re analyzing those moments for what can feel like hours. I  mean it can make you see things.”

Dr. Blackwell looked shocked. It  was the largest single display of reaction he probably saw on her face.  “You mean, you have seen it firsthand?”

“Oh yes, anyone can, so  long as Nick has activated them as a user, that’s what he and Ahmed call  it, anyway. Look, if you can help get Jack back home safely, it would  mean a lot to me and I’m sure would mean a lot to Nick. If you want to  see what all the fuss is about just come down to the lab and have him  show you how to use it.”

“Have you read your grandfather’s journal, the one about the relic?”

“No, I’ve only ever heard about it. I know where he keeps it but he doesn’t let anyone enter the room where he keeps it.”

“How  soon can you have Jack Starr come here, in secret, of course? Let’s get  that business out of the way and then I think I would like a  demonstration.”

“Do you think that’s safe?”

“As long as you don’t tell anyone, it should be. Sonny, do either of the Randall’s know about this granted user situation?”

“No, not really. Why do you ask?”

“It’s  just that the book, by all accounts, contains information about using  the relic. If Randall Senior knew you had or that he could get access to  use the relic, I believe he would take over the minute he learned about  it.”

Moments like this made him feel slow, mentally unfit. Why  hadn’t he thought of using the book before now? “May find out how soon I  can get Jack here.” He turned around toward the door and paused. He  looked back at Dr. Blackwell. “I should’ve come to you sooner, thank  you.” He left the room smiling.

Shocked her again! Twice in one day, unbelievable.

Sonny  went straight to the lab, a plan forming. He checked his watch. He had a  little over 12 hours until sunrise you wanted to have answers by the  time he called Aimee. Upon arriving in the lab he found a med and  Nicholas deep in conversation in front of a blackboard. Both of them  talking as fast as the tap tap squeak of the chalk giving Sonny the  impression that he was witnessing a piece of modern art or free-form  jazz. He looked around the room until he spotted the relic clamped into  the viewing platform of an optical microscope.

Neither of the men  given a second glance as he on clamped smooth black stone and held it in  front of him with his palm open. The bright blue line sprang forth like  a vine growing in time-lapse. With a feverish sense of anticipation, he  reached out and touched a spot about one-third of the way from the  beginning of the arc. An image of hardwood floors covered in blue and  red mats came to life. He pressed his thumb down onto the relic as Nick  had shown him.

That had been a pretty well-aimed guess, you  recognize, that seemed like it was yesterday. His first collegiate  wrestling championship. The moment he was looking for was just a few  weeks later when he returned home after winning in Randall Senior  invited him into his study. Sonny slid his thumb forward with this much  control as he could muster. It was like living on fast forward. He tried  not to vomit as the world blurred asked he stopped at the car ride on  the way to the family farm and lifted his thumb.
He watched for  what felt like hours, reliving the rare moment of family approval.  Finally, the moment arrived, and he set his thumb back down. Time  stopped. Randall Pera Senior stood in front of the bookcase at the back  of his study. Sonny was staring down at the glass of brandy in his right  hand. A moment before he had been reliving the emotions and thoughts,  they all evaporated when the scene froze. With an effort of will, and at  the cost of real physical stamina, Sonny moved his eyes from the  snifter. The sensation was like pulling one foot from the mud only to  find that your shoe had been left behind. He could focus on anything  inside of the room, provided it had been in his field of view, to begin  with.

Was a certain sense of revulsion seeing one’s own body  immobile while you are consciousness moved about a space. Gritting his  teeth with concentration, Sonny forced his focus to the bookshelf with  Randall Senior. Now to lift his thumb, if he could just find it. This  was something Nick had not warned him about. Now that his mind and body  occupied separate spaces, he seemed unable to control his body at all.

What  seemed so simplistic moments before now felt like a prison. He was in a  mental pit scrabbling along the edges, trying to dig himself back out.  With his consciousness detached from the anchor of its body, Sonny found  himself adrift in terrifying wires. Everything that Nick had shown him  and explained to him about using the relic evaporated in a tidal wave of  panic.

I’m stuck. What was I thinking? How did I end up here? Am I  really going to be frozen looking at the back of Randall Senior’s head  forever?

It was sometime before the troubling thoughts eased into a  more consistent pattern of worry. After what seemed more than an hour,  Sonny calmed himself completely. Once calm, a minor effort allowed him  to scan the room again. Behind him, his body sat snifter in hand,  leaning against the edge of Randall’s desk. There was a blurry quality  to his body like it was superimposed over another image.

With a  little mental work and effort, Sonny pierced the false image to realize  he was looking at himself in the lab. With that realization came the  knowledge of his body again, a momentary sensation of vertigo, but one  that ended in a warm blanket taken fresh from the dryer and wrapped  around cold limbs.

Sonny lifted his thumb and returned his  concentration to Randall Sr., who flipped the spine of a book sideways  and entered a 7  digit number into the vertical keypad underneath. That  was what he had come for. There was no need to watch Randall enter the  secret room or invite a younger Sonny in to gaze upon its contents as he  pulled his actual hand down to his side and opened his eyes back into  the lab.

Nick and Ahmed were still standing in front of the  chalkboard, having moved only slightly. Sonny was seeing the subtlety of  the relics of power. After clamping the stone back onto the  microscope’s platform, and left the room without being noticed. It was  time to visit the family farm.

The drive there passed in a blur,  with him only realizing he’d arrived when he had to stop at the gate.  The family farm wasn’t actually a farm anymore. Not for over 100 years.  It was 160  acres on the northern border of New York. For the last 40  years, Randall Sr lived here on the estate. He kept the rest of the land  kept only to use for hunting.

The estate itself boasted an indoor  and outdoor pool, a croquet green and tennis courts, a topiary, and a  greenhouse. As a child, Sonny had never appreciated how excessively rich  his family really was. It and college when he had realized the  difference between his family and the other wealthy students. He pulled  the car into the main turnaround of the large flagstone drive and  entered through the main doors.

Inside, the staff did not greet  him. No one was here. Or to be more precise, his family wasn’t here.  Most of the staff lived on-premises but in other buildings, only coming to the main house for upkeep or to take care of affairs for the family.

Without hesitation, funding to the steps. Time for the first flight. Just before reaching the third-floor landing. At the top he stopped for a quick breeder before pushing down the hall toward the study, marveling at the fact that Randall Senior still made this trip, probably. Inside the study, he flipped open the book spine typed in 2121823. There was a  loud click behind the wall and when Sonny pushed the bookcase to the  side, it slid in one smooth motion into the solid wood casement,  disappearing from sight.

The room on the other side was part exhibition chamber and part altar. His great great great uncles Journal on a pedestal front and center at the back of it. Around the sides of the room, all matters of treasures and antique-filled display cases and every blank space of the walls covered by portraits and newspaper articles framed with references: great deeds by the Shaw’s or the Pera’s.

Five minutes later, Sonny drove southward with the book on the passenger seat next to him. Sweat tickled his brow, and he wiped it off before nervously checking his watch. You can hardly believe it,  everything happened so fast. He still had nine hours before he needs to  call Aimee back. With any luck, he could find somewhere to make copies  of the journal in Watertown, return it to its place in the study, and be back in Syracuse with enough time to get a few hours of sleep before he had to call her.
