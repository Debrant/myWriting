"Huh, that's true. I've never seen Dr. Farouk draw blood himself," Christoph observed. " I wonder if he's squeamish about it? That's a funny thought." he pushed a cotton ball into the back of Nick's elbow as you withdrew the needle. "All set," he said while labeling the vials before sliding them neatly into the vertical test tube rack on the top shelf of the mini-fridge. "We will be taking more samples after today's tests, same as yesterday."

"Is Ahmed normally this cautious? I mean, are these protocols mandatory in these situations, or is it just his natural way of doing things?"

"I wouldn't really be at liberty to say, Dr. Farouk and I have worked together for six years now and this is the most hands-on he's ever been as far as I can tell. He's usually more of an analyzing delegate type, but he can go both ways with procedures. He's the smartest man I know, but being too smart doesn't always mix well with bureaucracy. Anyway, he's got his reasons and if he's being cautious, I'm more than happy to follow them."

"So you picked up anything yet on the dosimeters or the RIID?"

"Yes, a few times, but I wouldn't classify any of it as dangerous. I think he has other reasons for the caution if that's what you're worried about. Are you ready for the next session?" Nick nodded and Christoph ushered him out of the small one-bed hospital room in which he was staying.

Outside of the room was a small private hospital wing. A horseshoe-shaped hallway of creamy green floor tiles ran, probably asbestos, from the double doors around a nurse's station to wrap back around to a set of matching hospital doors on the opposite side of the horseshoe. There were eight rooms, three on the opposite, three on his side, and two across from the nurses' station. Behind the nurses' station, and directly across from his doors, was a lounge big enough for a dozen people were so to sit and drink coffee or eat the snacks available in one of the three vending machines. As far as he knew, he was the only person in any of the rooms and Nick had no idea whether he was actually in a hospital or in some secret base of the Founders designed to resemble one.

They exited the double doors, continuing down the butterscotch hallways on their way to an area called Radiology and Testing. Nick had not seen a single normal x-ray machine anywhere inside of the radiology department and had never been to a hospital with so many laboratory instruments for measurements and detection. The radiology department contained all manners of equipment though, from radio transmitters and detectors to radiation measurement and detection devices.

Today was the third day of official testing. Christoph would lead him into an x-ray theater room, minus the x-ray machines. And then retreat to safety outside the room where he and Dr. Farouk would ask him to do tasks with the relic while measuring and recording across as many spectrums as possible.

Shadows played in the golden light spilling through the window onto the floor in front of the theater as they approached. With another two steps, the area through the glass came into focus, revealing an unexpected scene. Sonny Pera stood an arms' length from Dr. Farouk, whose face showed no reaction to the larger man's wildly moving arms. Nick extended a finger toward the intercom button, lifting an eyebrow quizzically at Christoph. When the other man shrugged, he flipped the comm channel open.

"Everything, everyone, reports directly to me or Dr. Blackwell from here on out." Sonny's voice sounded strangely devoid of emotion, contrasting his energetic body language.

"And I told you, you do not have the authority to make that claim without a seal from one of the Council. You could just bring Dr. Blackwell in here to tell me herself, and that would also be acceptable, but until such time agent Pera, I report to Carter Holland."

"Holland is dead. Are you telling me Blackwell didn't inform you?"


Ahmed took a step backward. "No, no, what happened?"

"We were bringing Jack Starr here on request of Dr. Blackwell. Holland waited for me to get dropped off at my father's. He must have planted a bug on one of us. Our tactical officer Darren Horne was to drive from my father's farm back here to deliver Jack. Holland ambushed him near the high creek crossing and rammed them off the road."

Farouk deflated, sinking into a chair near the wall. He put his forehead in his hands, shaking his head. "Why would Carter care if Blackwell had Jack Starr? None of this makes any sense"

"I can't answer those questions, doctor. I only have the report from the incident, I wasn’t there. Holland pulled Jack Starr from the back of the van before Horne could recover from the crash. He executed Jack on the spot and then tried to kill Darren. Darren fought back, forcing Holland to retreat. Horne is certain that he shot Holland as he was running away. He assumed the other man was wearing body armor, and so kept firing as he chased him up the hill and back to the car. He must've hit the car as Holland pulled away, causing it to crash. The car caught on fire, went end over end down the hill, and blew up. By the time Darren could get close to it, Holland was…"

Sonny shook his head. "the body is downstairs. Randall Sr. wants a complete analysis. He suspects Holland was drugged. He won't accept that Holland would do this voluntarily until all other explanations are exhausted. So I will take over Holland's role here until we figure out what happened and why."

Nick turned off the intercom. "On second thought, I forgot I need to use the bathroom before we start today's session." Christoph followed him back out into the hallway and waited for him outside of the door.

Goddammit! Did Holland really go and get himself killed?


He didn't trust a word regarding Holland trying to kill Jack. All of it sounded like horseshit, but if they had a body and they were asking Ahmed to analyze it. Damn! He stood staring into the boyish face in the mirror. Nick took to ragged breath, forced his eyes closed tight to block the reflection from his view.

There was nothing to do now except cater to Dr. Blackwell's requests. Her agenda was separate from whatever games of power the Pera family orchestrated. Despite not knowing what she was driving at, his options were dwindling fast. With an effort, he forced himself to recall their last session. On a whim, Nick had been candid with Dr. Blackwell. Now he fought a vertigo of doubt. Had he sold out Holland?

"Nick," she had said, her voice dropping in tone and volume. "Generations have admired the Pera family as masters of the occult. Randall Pera Sr. has a handwritten journal written by his great-great-uncle. In it are three decades of research notes beginning in the late 1700s. The subject of the journal is a device much like the one that we've been testing with you here. Randal inherited this mindless pursuit from his grandfather and it has been tainting the ranks of the Founders for over a century now."

That had captured his attention, "can you get access to the book?"

She squinted at him, her eyes boring into him as if she could dissect his mind simply by staring. "In the handful of times has used it with me present, only once has Randall Sr. allowed me a glimpse of its pages. He doesn't let anyone touch it. It's interesting that you focused on it immediately. Do you believe it to hold some type of power?"

That was when the whim had struck him. At that moment he had judged her willing to exchange information over quid pro quo. "I know it does," he'd told her.

He watched as the small muscles around her eyes hardened and could almost sense her emotional detachment at those words. But Nick remained calm, keeping eye contact until, like a puppet on a marionette, Dr. Blackwell's eyes widened and her spine straightened in her seat.

"What are your reasons for believing that?" She had arrived at the correct question.

"Because for me it has been decades since I found that thing. I have lived and died and been reborn. I don't mean reincarnation, but as this." Nick thumped his chest over his heart. "One moment dying, the next awakened to the exact moment on December 2, 1984, in which your organization detected the anomaly."


Blackwell's jaw unhinged as she drew a breath, but Nick cut her off. "Wait, there is more. When I am holding the stone in front of me like this." He held his palm up at roughly chin level in front of his eyes. "The device, relic, or whatever you want to call it plots a graph of the lives I've lived like a timeline only visible to me. Each of the lines painted a different color in an imaginary space superimposed over my vision. If I touch a point on one of those timelines, I can review in perfect detail the events that happened there from my point of view."

Dr. Blackwell's mouth drew back into a thin line. Her eyes were hard again. When she didn't respond Nick continued, "for a woman of your education and intellect it should be easy to identify several ways for me to validate this claim experimentally. For expediency's sake, I suggest you take a moment to identify the method that will satisfy you so that we may move past skepticism and into a working relationship."

She'd sent him back to his room but had been waiting for him that first evening following his testing with Dr. Farouk. After satisfying a number of her tests, she'd been a different woman. Peering deep into his eyes, she shook his hand firmly before retreating for the night. "Thank you for trusting me with this, Mr. Starr. You have given me quite a lot to think about. Will you join me for breakfast tomorrow?"

At breakfast, she laid out the schism inside the Order of the Founders. The roots of the schism traced back to Europe. Men of power, wealth, and influence from the old country brought with them the accouterments and rituals of their occult pasts. The separation of church and state laid out in the Constitution was no accident, it was a compromise. Behind the scenes, the puppet masters themselves couldn't agree.

Dr. Blackwell claimed the founding members were, like many peer groups, originally intended to be a venue for nonpublic debates among a very select group of influential members. Intentionally removed from the official roles of government and by design requiring its own budgets, the newly formed Order of the Founders fell into disagreement within the first year. Influence does not equate to power unless applied and contrary to popular belief, is not knowledge that is power, but the applied use of that knowledge. How and where to apply influence and spend resources was an immediate point of contention.

The original members, educated and rational men all, but a handful could not resist the allure of occult powers that beckoned from the old world. These few advocated for the use of the Order's resources to pursue occult knowledge. One of those members, Gabriel Shaw, the same great-great-uncle of Randall Pera Sr., came from nowhere, amassing power and influence at an astounding pace. He worked his way into the Order from two simultaneous fronts, one through marriage and one by purchase.

He was a wildly enigmatic and romantic figure until the very end of his life. When reportedly he held a ritual in secret from the Council. The elaborate rite supposedly carried Shaw’s spirit on to the next plane of existence. In Gabriel’s will, he had left his diary, the same book Randall Pera Sr. now carried, to his nephew. Dr. Blackwell had never verified its contents, but there were enough rumors over the years to have made it into the historical archives. Investigations that claimed the book explained how a magic rock called the relic had been responsible for Gabriel's success.

"Randall sees the relic as a birthright that Gabriel Shaw had intended to be passed down to his sister's children, having had none himself." She continued, "You know most of the rest firsthand, Randall Pera Sr. converted many of the Order into believing that the relic held the keys to a better future. One that he was ready to make happen, and only he could."

Blackwell had grown up in a family with ties to the Founders. Her father had also been a scientist and a skeptical detractor, frequently voicing against the continued pursuit of the relic. In her version, the Order was a group dedicated to the perseverance of democracy and liberty. One fighting for its very existence against the subversive allure of imagined power.
Nick wasn't sure that he trusted her version of events any more than he was sure that she believed him, although he met her tests and passed. What she was asking though was for him to befriend Sonny Pera, who according to her was a prime candidate for rebelling against his family.

With Sonny taking over from Holland, he would have no choice but to follow that plan now. But there was something about Sonny that repulsed him, made his skin crawl. He took another deep breath, turned on the water, and washed his hands and face.


Stepping out of the bathroom, Nick turned to Christoph. "All better," he said with a smile and walked back to the x-ray theater.

The door was open when they returned, and Ahmed was nowhere to be seen. Sonny set in a tall rolling chair, spinning in slow circles. "Christoph, you 're late."

Nick responded first. "yeah, sorry. That's my fault, I forgot to use the bathroom. Where is Dr. Farouk?"

"Nick, come in and have a seat. I'm afraid I have some bad news. Christoph, we're going to skip this evening’s session. I need to have a conversation with Mr. Starr, privately. Why don't you call it a day? I'll make sure that Nick makes it back to his room."


Christoph paused, looking from Sonny to Nick and back to sunny before shrugging. "All right, see you tomorrow then," he said as he left.

They sat in silence, Nick trying to look casual but curious while Sonny looked like a gorilla stuffed into a polo shirt, unsure about the zookeeper.

"Come on then, what's the bad news?"

Sonny cleared his throat while staring at the floor. "Dr. Farouk isn't here because he," he stopped. He took a deep breath and then looked at Nick before continuing. "He has to autopsy Holland's body." A few small drops of sweat puckered their way across Pera's forehead. "Nick, your dad was in the car crash that killed Holland. It killed them both, I'm sorry."

Either Sonny is an excellent actor or he genuinely feels remorse, but for what, that’s the question. Well, this is a perfect segue into Dr. Blackwell's areas of interest. Sometimes you have to play the cards you're dealt.

"Did you kill Holland?"

Sonny rocked back in his chair as if Nick slapped him. "No! Technically Darren Horne killed him, but he attacked Darren first."

"But doesn't sound much like Holland. Why was Jack there?"

"Jack was there because I couldn't leave him in New Orleans. He was supposed to help me bring you in. You ran and then he attacked a cop. Jack and I were friends, I didn't want any of this to happen."

"You figured out I was working with Holland and, okay, I'll concede you didn't kill him. It looks a little suspicious though doesn't it? Try it from my point of view, you had Jack in that ridiculous mansion on Audubon Place. I knew there was no safe way for me to get him out, so I turned myself into Holland. Holland treated you with respect and even tried to take you under his wing, but everyone knows you couldn't stand him. Now my dad and Holland both end up dead? And you say Jack was your friend. I think you used him to get to Holland, and he was just collateral damage."

Sonny's face turned red, and he stood up fast, knocking his chair over. He glared at Nick so hard that his eyeballs appeared to be pushing forward. After a moment he turned around, "let's go for a walk." Nick didn't stand up to join him and after a moment Sonny cupped his forehead to wipe away the sweat. "This room has remote surveillance capabilities. I turned everything off when I came in, but that doesn't mean someone with access couldn't turn things back on. Let's go for a walk there's a little courtyard where we can sit outside and have a conversation with zero chance of being overheard."

With a nod, Nick followed him out of the room and further into the hospital than he'd ever been before. True to his word, Sonny led them into a small square courtyard with the path that bisected to treed grassy areas as it ran from one building to another. Halfway between the two buildings set a single bench across from a fountain in a circle of concrete.

Sonny sat down at one end of the bench and motioned Nick to join him. "Almost no one comes here, but before you get any ideas, the key I have only unlocked the door we just came through and there's a guarded checkpoint to exit the building." The side of his mouth pulled back in a half grimace, half-smile.

"You've changed since the last time we met," Nick said as he sat at the other end of the bench. He rotated his back onto the armrest, pulling one hip and thigh slightly onto the bench to keep Sonny in front of him.

"That's what Aimee says too. It's mostly her. I don't know why I'm telling you, but she's not like anybody I've ever dated before."

"You mean not white?"

Sonny flinched. "No that's not what I meant. Some of it's your fault as well."

"What's that?" He had a pretty good idea, but now they were sitting here, he realized it was more than just lip service. Sonny had changed.

"Post-Concussion Syndrome, TBI, whatever they call it. You did more than ring my bell back in Vegas. I still struggle with vertigo a few times a week." Sonny's entire demeanor was a man turned inward on himself. A wistful smile played across his face.

"For what it's worth, I didn't mean to hurt you that bad. You're a lot bigger and faster than I gave you credit for. It wasn't so much how hard I hit you, but how hard you hit my knee. The damn thing was black and blue for a month."

Now Sonny smiled for real, gave a small chuckle. "Glad to hear it. I was pretty mad at you for a long time. You're not wrong about Holland. It wasn't me, but it was my family. My father and my grandfather, they've been searching for the relic all their lives. Everything's a conspiracy with them, oh shit! I'm such an asshole, Nick, Jack isn’t dead. You're right about him being the leverage to get Holland out to our property."

"If Jack's alive, whose body is in the basement?"

"Darren only brought one body back. The official version is that Holland's body flew free during the crash, but it trapped Jack in the car and burned beyond recognition. But Aimee took him, he is probably in Puerto Rico by now with her family. I couldn't do it, my family thinks he's buried in Labrador Hollow, so does Darren Horne."

"Why are you telling me this?"

"Because you deserve to know, and I'm not mad anymore. In a weird way, I feel like I should thank you. Aimee told me herself that she changed her mind about my being a conceited jerk while taking care of me in the aftermath of Vegas. She would've never gone for a guy like me otherwise. Look, Nick, I don't know what's going to happen to you, that's out of my control. If you can give them what they want, I will do my best to get you out of here. Truthfully, I didn't think Holland would…"

It was amazing how some men just can't amount to anything without a woman to set them on the path. He liked this version of Sonny, a little broken but with a streak of good humor and something to look forward to. Nick held out his hand. "Sonny Pera, it's good to meet you, again. Thank you." Nick leaned back, looking up at the patch of sky above the buildings. Somewhere out of sight, the sun had already cooked the bricks near the top so that the air shimmered.

For now, I think it's best to play both sides.

He looked back down at Sonny. "I have a confession to make, but you can't hold it against Dr. Farouk. Holland took the lead on everything and talked him into it. I'll do my best to bring you up to speed as I did for them. I showed them how to use it but not last week. I met with them back in May."
