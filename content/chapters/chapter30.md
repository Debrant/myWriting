"I'm proud of you," Aimee told him. "Getting Jack out of danger was the right thing to do."

"Thanks, I think. I do feel relieved, kinda lighter, ya know?" Sonny responded.

"So what now? Do you have to go straight back to work?"

"Maybe not right away. What did you have in mind?"

"I'm pretty hungry, let's go back to your place and get cleaned up to go out. Do you think that little place next to the river you took me to last time is open on Tuesdays?"

Sonny checked the rear-view mirror again. Has that car been with us since the airport? He changed lanes and slowed down.

Aimee pushed his arm. "Hey, what's wrong?"

"Nothing, I thought we were being followed. What were you saying?"

"I was asking about dinner. Do you think," she stopped talking mid-sentence as Sonny swerved violently back into the fast lane, pushing the accelerator hard.

"Dammit," he swore. "We should have taken my car. This thing is gutless. Hold on," he yanked the steering wheel back and forth, weaving between the other vehicles.

Aimee turned halfway around in her seat, staring out the window. "Shit Sonny, I think that's Darren." Sonny watched the black interceptor ducking in and out of the lanes behind. The front lights on the left side were all smashed in and now that he was looking, the hood appeared bent as well. If it hadn't been for the missing headlights, he never would have noticed.

There was no way they were shaking him in this rented 6-cylinder. He had to do something drastic. Ahead, about 500 feet was an off-ramp. He scanned the traffic patterns, looking for a suitable spot to cut through but box Darren in. Four cars up a slow driver in the left lane had people passing on the right. It was a perfect spot. He accelerated as hard as the car would allow, the gap between the pack of cars waiting to pass closed quickly.

Pushing right up on someone's bumper, Sonny began honking and flashing his lights. After a few seconds, the car ahead pulled over to the right. Now! Sonny used the gap to speed forward, crossing the shoulder at the last minute and passing the old man in the slow car on the left side, tires kicking up rocks and dust from the edge of the highway.

Sorry pal, Sonny thought as he pulled hard back to the right, turning nearly perpendicular to the oncoming traffic. The timing had been near to perfection as he cut across close enough to startle both the old man and the driver of the car he'd forced over. Breaks squealed and tire rubber filled the air behind him as Sonny sped up the hill of triangular grass. The car pitched forward, then bounced back up, rocking like a boat as the springs struggled to compensate for the sudden off-road route. Near perfect, but not quite, Sonny had to angle back to avoid the guardrail that began halfway up the off-ramp.

The car fish-tailed in the grass as Sonny tried to compensate for the lack of traction. With a final yank back to the left, aiming at the pavement, Sonny gunned it. He chanced a look back at the growing traffic jam he'd created. About thirty cars now sat congested, with what looked to be a few minor rear-end collisions. At first there Sonny couldn't find Darren's black sedan in the mix, but with a second glance as he came to the light at the top of the ramp, Sonny spotted a patch of smoke. Behind it, the powerful interceptor engine pushed a green station wagon toward the far side of the highway.

As Sonny turned left to cross the overpass, Darren was speeding out of the pack through the hole he had forced open. "Did he see us?" Aimee's voice snapped out of his hyperfocused state. Sonny glanced to the right in time to see the speeding car turn suddenly at a break in the center rail to cross the green expanse between the north and southbound lanes of the 390.

"Shit! He's going for the off-ramp on the other side!" Sonny pushed the pedal down, hard.

Paper crinkling drew his eyes to Aimee's lap as she unfolded and smoothed a highway map of New York. "Nice thinking, sometimes I forget you do this for a living too," Sonny said with a smile. Somehow, knowing she was working on the problem with him, lowered his heart rate and eased the pressure seizing his chest.

"Take a left before, at the end of the road, we're going to pass the Rochester Dome on the right in about a mile, if there is any venue traffic pull into it. That service road loops all the way around the Dome and should provide cover. Do you know the area?"

"Not really, hold on." his weight shifted, pushing him into the center console as he took the left without slowing down. The rental car protested in a series of squeals and shudders but held together. There was no sign of Darren behind them. Sonny kept the pedal pushed to the floor anyway. Ahead, several semi-trucks pulling trailers lined the single eastbound lane.

"Come on, come on baby, you can do it." Sonny patted the dashboard. "Just gimme a little more," he told the car while swinging out into the opposite lane. More trucks, but he guessed that there was enough time to pass the first truck in his lane. Thirty seconds stretched to an eternity as the gap he was aiming for seemed to inch closer, while the oncoming tractor-trailer doubled in size.

The driver on his right gave him a long pull on the air horn. Baaaagh! Baaaargh! The truck fell behind and Sonny swerved into the newly opened spot. "This thing is slower than I thought, that was close." he stuck a hand out the window to wave thanks to the driver behind him. A few hundred feet further on, trucks were turning toward the Dome. "It looks like they are setting up or tearing down. No cars, only trucks down that road. I don't like it, what's my path if I don't want to go that way?"

Aimee looked out at the traffic flowing toward the Dome and then back out the window before returning to the map. "We should get back to the hospital. Dr. Blackwell won't stand for this infighting. Take a left at the end of this road, we'll work our way back to the 390 using 15A, before heading west to north on the 590. We can skip the toll roads and come on 104 all the way to Hannibal."

Sonny nodded while keeping the car near the right shoulder. The truck in front turned, leaving the road ahead wide open. With only one truck behind, he watched the rearview, with his stomach-turning. The friendly driver who had let them in turn, and Sonny blew out a long breath as his skin prickled with relief. "I think we lost him."

As they turned back to the north, Sonny felt his cheeks flush and the familiar sour burn of rage. "Fucking Darren! I should have never left him alone with my dad. They got to him, and that means he told them about us and Jack! My fucking family is trying to kill me!" He was yelling to hold back tears of frustration.

The smooth touch of Aimee's hand on his forearm made him flinch. She wisely didn't offer any comment, only gave him a firm squeeze. Ten seconds later, she removed her grip, and he found he missed it instantly. Sonny switched his grip on the steering wheel and reached over to take Aimee's hand. "Let's get some take-out or something, I'm hungry and we have a couple of hours of driving ahead of us."

She said nothing for a moment, looking worried. With a squeeze, she tightened her grip and said, "yeah, I could eat. Let's hit the first place we see."

It took nearly forty minutes to find anything open within sight of the route they were on, but when an authentic roadside burger joint caught Sonny's eye he smiled. "Orbaker's! I've been here before," he said, swinging into the parking lot. "I came here with the wrestling team after a tournament back in high school. Great malts, is this okay with you?" He asked, a little belatedly.

"Looks cute, we might as well eat at the counter, I know it's corny but it makes me feel like I'm in a movie."

Sonny parked in front and hopped out in a hurry to get to Aimee's door. She laughed at him but took his offered hand on the way out of the car. Inside, the red Formica counter seemed to meet Aimee's approval, because she pulled him by the hand to the unoccupied corner by the window.

With two burgers, homemade chips and two large malted strawberry shakes in front of them, Sonny and Aimee tried to forget the last hour of stress and ate while chatting and laughing about Jack's puppy-dog routine. At first, Sonny didn't pay any attention to the New York State Police car that pulled off the highway to park near the door, but when three more joined it, Sonny motioned at the window to Aimee. The Troopers were all out of their car now, four of them moving to the doors, while several more inspected Aimee's white rental car.

It was already too late to run, so instead Sonny took out his badge and unfolded it to show both the shield and his photo. He stood up and turned to face the doors as the officers opened them. Sonny held his ID at head level to ensure they could easily make the match, Sonny Called out first, "FBI, stand down!" Two officers came in and moved to the sides of the doors to let the others in. They did not take their hand away from their pistol grip, but they didn't draw their weapons.

The next two through the door slid around between the tables and the counter to stand behind Aimee. One of them, a thick armed man with a buzz speckled with grey, reached out to take the leather bi-fold from Sonny. "I'm going to have to call this in," he said, taking the badge with him as he left the restaurant. Two more officers entered, taking his place. No one said anything. The only other guests in the restaurant looked more excited than scared as they stared at the scene before them.

After several tense minutes, the buzz cut returned, and with some unseen signal; the rest relaxed their posture. "I'm sorry to bother you, Agent Pera, but would you mind stepping outside to answer a few questions?"

"What's this about, officer?" Sonny replied without moving.

"We just need to clear up a few details, sir. Now, if you don't mind." he placed a hand on Sonny's lower back, extending the other toward the door.

When Aimee moved to stand up, the officer behind her pressed her back onto the barstool. "Not you, Chiquita, let the men talk. You just stay right here." A little pit of rage returned to Sonny's stomach, but he allowed himself to be ushered to the lot outside.

Outside, the officer behind him placed a hand on Sonny's shoulder. "Where's your sidearm?"

"Left side, shoulder holster," Sonny replied. "Is this really necessary?" Sonny asked as they lifted his gun from its leather sling.

The other man didn't answer, instead, he pushed Sonny against the patrol car. "Please lace your fingers behind your head." Sonny scanned the gravel parking lot. Two officers had drawn their weapons and stood at ready to either side behind the car he was leaning on. He laced his fingers to the sound of blood rushing in his ears. The hard metal slapped his right wrist, flinging the ratcheting end of the cuff in a quick loop with enough force to click twice. The officer's grip forced two more clicks, making the restraint tight before he yanked Sonny's hands down one at a time and secured them together.

The car door swung open and a hand on the back of his head forced him down into the backseat. Boom! The door slammed shut, rocking the car and sending a wave of air with the sound. His escorting officer slid into the front and picked up the radio, but then cut a look back at Sonny and placed the receiver back onto the cradle. With a flick, he turned off the radio before climbing out and shutting the door.

Sonny watched him through the door, waving one of the other officers over. Their pantomimed conversation was simple enough, even without hearing them. "Call this in, I don't want him to hear me." Sonny guessed. He continued watching the officer who seemed in charge waved in at the diner, followed by pointing at the backseat of the car next to them. Sonny's heart sank for a moment until the second officer rotated his torso to look in the window.

"Ben! Ben! It's me, Sonny Pera. We worked on Snyder's murder together last year." He yelled into the glass, hoping to be heard. It must have worked. Ben turned back and began a new conversation. There seemed to be some confusion as the remaining officers exited the building with Aimee cuffed. They shoved her into the car next to his. But an argument had enveloped at least six of the officers just between his car and Aimee's.

After a few semi-heated exchanges they seemed to reach a consensus and the group broke up, each going in pairs to separate cars. The door opened. "Hey come on out of there, Sonny," Ben said, leaning into the open door.

He slid over and swung his legs out onto the ground to stand next to Ben, who turned him around and removed the handcuffs. "Sorry about all of this, but we have a statewide APB out on your car and two drivers matching your descriptions. Dispatch said your little Cuban Mamacita there is a known, communist spy. We have orders to take you both in."

"She's Puerto Rican, not Cuban, and she works for the fucking government. If you thought that, why did you just uncuff me then?"

"Dispatch said you were posing as FBI, but I vouched for you. You still need to come with us, but out of respect, we are letting you drive yourself. Unless you would rather ride in the back?"

"No, sorry Ben, thank you for standing up for me. This is just a ploy by some very bad people who are trying to stop me from doing my job. Aimee is a high-value analyst and we need to get back on the road ASAP."

"Sorry man, no can do. You either drive with us back to Troop E or we impound your ride and take you there. Order are orders."

Sonny nodded and reached out to take the keys back. "Middle of the pack?"

Ben nodded back and began walking to the car by the doors when the cashier came out, stress wrinkles creasing her forehead. "Hey, is somebody going to pay their tab?" She stood holding the door half open and refusing to come all the way out.

Sam looked at Sonny, who rolled his eyes and shrugged. Sam turned back with a sigh. "how much is it," he asked.

"Ten fifty-six with tax," she replied with a little more confidence.

The trooper dug in his wallet and came out with eleven dollars. "Keep the change," he said, handing the paper over. She just stared at him with lips pursed until he fished a few more singles out and handed them over. "for your trouble." Ben shot Sonny a hard-eyed look, but Sonny just laughed and shrugged again as he got into Aimee's rental car.

The sun was just turning the sky into pink fire forty minutes later as they pulled into the Troop E station in Farmington. The realization that Darren had most likely used a car phone to call the APB in had him berating himself for not listening to Holland more. He should have switched vehicles as soon as they had gotten clear from view.

The black iron gate rolled open as the convoy pulled past the long, low red-bricked station and turned into the lot behind it. With an arm out the window of the car ahead, the trooper waved him to park along the side of the building. The gate slid closed with a clang as he stepped out to wait for the others.

The group split in two, half taking Aimee toward the rear and the other half joining Sonny to enter the door near his parking spot. Ben held open the door. "come on, we've had some updates on the drive down and the Major wants to speak with you."

Straight to troop Commander, no wonder we drove so far. Darren must have at least one of the Randall's in on this. Speak of the fucking devil!

Darren Horne's bulky torso dwarfed that of Troop E's Commander as the two shook hands in front of the office at the end of the hall. With a wink and a smile, Darren made off, heading toward Sonny's left. "Where's he going," Sonny asked the Major as they came to the door.

"None of your business Agent, get in there and sit down. Trooper Smood, I have it from here. Get back out on patrol." Ben gave a curt nod and left without another word. Wondering where this was going, Sonny took a seat across the Commander's desk.

The Commander was a slim man in his fifties with sharp eyes and a dour demeanor. Sonny couldn't remember meeting him before. He took his seat and picked up the phone, punching in a succession of numbers from a notepad next to the phone. "Yes, I have him here now. Do you want to speak with him?"

The Major turned the phone around and stood up to slide it over in front of Sonny, then left the room shutting the door behind him.

Sonny placed the receiver to his ear. "Hello?"

"Listen, if you were anyone other than a Pera, you'd be dead right now. As it stands, I am running out of patience with your shenanigans." Randal Senior's gravel-like voice was measured and even, which set the hair on Sonny's arms on end. "Darren is on his way back here right now with your little Mexican whore, and if you want to see her again, you're going to do exactly what I tell you to. Is that understood?"

Sonny wobbled on his feet, dizzy like he'd stood up too fast. Doors of possibility were slamming shut in his mind and every heartbeat brought crushing panic. "Goddammit, Sonny! This is not the time to go full retard, do you understand me?"

"Yes, sir," was all he could manage.

"Good, now pay attention," Randall began, and Sonny felt himself slipping away from reality as he listened to the old man rant.
