Something was terribly wrong.

Nick’s head was imploding in a massive bear trap of pain. Waves of nausea threatened to spill his stomach. Vertigo tore away all references. Then, all at once, the pain from the bullet and the rebirth faded away. He was getting better at this.

Nick rolled over onto his hands and knees, careful not to squish the little black schnauzer that had been trying to climb onto his chest. "It's good to see you, Pumpkin," Nick told the dog as he scratched between its ears. The relic lay just a few inches away, where he must've dropped it all those years ago the very first time he found it. Nick stared at the blackness of the stone. Suddenly, overcome with emotion, he began to cry.

He let the stress of dozens of lifetimes pour out of him for what felt like an hour. When he finished, the shadows were lengthening. He was cold and exhausted. Rising to his feet, a sense of calm relief settled over him. Nick tucked the relic into his pocket and then stepped out of the circle of melted snow to retrieve the lunch box Jeannie packed for him.


Turning to trench his way up out of the ravine, Nick breathed deeply. It was good to know where Holland would be. Maybe he would go there next time or the time after. Despite the temptation to just lie down and let his body die, he knew he didn't have that type of willpower. Also, it wouldn't do any good, anyway. Nick bent down and picked up Pumpkin, and turned back to call for the other dog, who was sniffing and digging around the spot where the relic left a hole. "Come on Pepper, it's time to go home." The black-and-white shopper raced past him along the ridge before he'd made 20 more feet. Nick smiled and kept walking.

By the time his grandfather's cabin came into view, the beginning of a plan had taken shape. Unexpectedly, his mind had drifted to his friend Isadore, the man that taught him sports betting what seemed years ago now. Isadore's nephew, Emile Klein, was a research psychiatrist with a doctorate in neuroscience was working on. As Isa put it, a “very sexy” theory of extra-dimensional human awareness and the core personality of the brain.

Even though the last iteration was a crushing disappointment on many fronts, Nick had learned loads about the use and operation of the relic. He was eager to re-initiate Danny using the new method. If it worked, it would save Nick dozens of hours, if not more, per person on each pass. This would be great, because the sooner he initiated Emile Klein, the sooner they could get to work.

"Did you have yourself an adventure?" Jeanie asked as he rounded a bend in the path. "We were starting to get a little worried. You've been out here a long time."

“Yeah,” he said with a smile. “A grand adventure. Am I too late for dinner?"

"Of course not," she answered, smiling back and reaching out to take Pumpkin from him. "We were waiting for you."
