Nicholas lay awake with a sheen of sweat covering his body despite the chill falling off the windows. Every swallow was tight in his throat and produced too much saliva. Tomorrow was January 2, 1985, and he would have to return to school. He'd been lying here in bed unable to think of anything else for hours. Sleep eluded him.


The previous week was a blur. Jack had not come home for several days following the family movie. Arriving on Christmas eve to drop off a few presents before pulling Jane into the hallway. When she came back in she all but ran to her room slamming the door hard enough to shake the walls. Jack was there again on Christmas morning, but he and Jane refused to even make eye contact. In the aftermath of opening presents, he asked Nick to take Saul out of the house to play with some of the new toys.


Dad was sitting with his coat on and a bag overflowing with clothes at his feet when they came back. He leaned forward with his fingers steepled and elbows on his knees. His face unreadable as he spoke, "Hey guys," he gave them a sheepish grin. "Sit down for a minute."


"You know how your mother and I are always fighting?" He began. Nick cut a sideways glance at Saul to find him pinch-faced and holding his breath. A look of terror growing behind his eyes. "We are going to try to do things apart for a while." Jack began to lift himself from the chair. Nick caught his eye, frowning, and jerked his head toward Saul.


Jack rolled his eyes but conceded. "Look I've got a new place and you guys can come over there anytime you want. It'll be fun. Anyways, this is about me and your mom. It has nothing to do with you boys. I love you both."


Nick could hear Saul grinding his teeth. When he tried to reach out to put a hand on his brother's shoulder, Saul stood up face red and stormed into his room. Nick looked at Jack, "you're going to have to do better than that with him." Jack stood with him and as Nick made to leave offered a final goodbye, "later dad."


"Later son."


He was getting tired now, mind wandering over to his mother. She still seemed to be spending most of her time sequestered in her room. He had tried to cheer her, but it didn't seem to have worked. Sleep was claiming him at last as he tried to remember what time Saul needed to be at the bus stop.


The alarm cut through the warmth of sleep like a dull blade of ice. The room swam for a moment, pulsing to the rhythmic blare before his hand found the off button.


7 AM? I've been an early riser my whole life still feels like murder. Still can't believe politicians never got that one straight. Sending kids to school this early, maybe I'll do something about it


Nick's knuckles made a hollow Gak Gak sound against the door, "it's time to get up and eat breakfast." He set out the cereal and the milk before making his way to the bathroom to get cleaned up.


Saul was finishing his breakfast when he walked back through the living room. Nick looked at the old clock on the wall, "you got 20 minutes to get dressed I'll walk you to the bus stop."


"No way fag!"


"Saul, you can't talk like that." Nick retreated into his room shaking his head. The clothes he had laid out folded in even stacks on the old chest against the wall. He dressed and picked up his pack before returning to the living room and pouring himself a bowl of cereal.


The Count Chocula turned his milk brown but tasted good.


I wonder if half of maturity is physiological?


Saul came back out looking disheveled but otherwise ready to go. Nick finished the bowl then stood up to fix his brother's collar and straighten his hair.


"Don't touch me fag," he said slapping at Nick's hands.


"That's twice you've said that now Saul. What do you think that means?"


"It means you're a fucking Homo."


"Yeah. Okay, and what if I was? Are you going to fight me? Does that make me a bad person? Or are you worried that the gay is gonna rub off on you?"


Saul's mouth fell open but no sound came out of it. After a moment it began to open and close, "but, but, but."


"Just quit saying it, okay? Come on it's time to get to your bus stop." In the elevator, Nick continued, "I want you to think about it, Saul. Don't get mad, and don't make that face at me. Mom is having a hard time right now and dad's not here, so you got me. I'm your big brother and I know I can be a fuck up."


"No duh," Saul countered.


 "But mostly that was because I was bored. We don't get to be bored anymore, neither of us. We have to step up and act like men, okay? I want you to try not to call people names, it makes you look...Just don't do it."








He didn't believe a word I said, probably thinks I am nuts. Probably right. He reflected as the bus pulled away. Nick made his way around the corner onto 17th Street. It was only a block and a half to the old entrance behind the football field.


As he grew nearer the bleachers loomed over the darkened faculty parking lot. He entered through the double chain-link gates and made his way up the sloped driveway. In the dim depths under the bleachers, the shadows played games, creating an alternate reality. A few students huddled around the back of the bathrooms. They eyed him like hungry predators, hiding their cigarettes as he made his way by.


Nick made his way up the stairs and onto the track that surrounded the football field. Lincoln high school sat a full 15 feet above looking down on him.


More stairs cut up on either side to a great open patio. White painted castle-like railings that looked out over the football field below. A large square garden at the center held the flagpole flying red white and blue over the blue and gold Oregon's state.


Two large sets of double glass doors sat like sentinels on either side of the garden flag space. Nick stood there at the top of the stairs for a moment staring. Raucous groups of teenagers streamed by in groups of twos and threes. He was unprepared for the noise. Everyone competed at being able to talk over everyone else.


He found himself retreating into his breathing exercises. He was considering calling the entire thing off when he saw a familiar face.


"Hey, Nick, what you doing?" This was, Ian from his Biology class?


"Not much Ian, how was your holiday?"


"Way too short, I don't want to be here today. You know they're gonna give us a whole week's worth of homework even though it's Wednesday already. See you."


Okay, that wasn't too bad. I guess it's all in there somewhere. Let's hope the names just popped in my head with the faces.


On the way through the front doors arms encircled him from behind in a tight embrace. He looked down at the small pale arms with bright painted nails on the manicured hands.


"Ah, hello?" The hands held him and there was naught to do but wait. When the grip slackened, a tiny raccoon-eyed girl with spiky blond hair stepped around him into view. She a punk rock look sporting a torn up white shirt under a shoulder-padded crop top denim jacket. Her big blue eyes devoured him where he stood.


"I missed you so much! Why didn't you call me when you got back?" She was pulling the front of his shirt in an effort to get him to bend down. With a start, he realized that she was trying to kiss him and he recoiled taking a step backward.


"Oh my God!" She cried and burst into tears. Another, taller girl with thick blond curls stepped in front of him. Then she delivered a punch straight at his chest.


"Jesus Nick, you big jerk, look what you did." She yelled at him fist bouncing off of his chest.


"I, I." He couldn't think of anything.


"Come on Sarah," she said wrapping the smaller girl in a protective embrace. "You don't have to sit here and listen to this dweeb try to come up with excuses. He didn't call and he's and he's pulling away like he's afraid to touch you. He's either cheated or he's breaking up with you."


Sarah began crying even harder trying to move around Aisha to get at Nick. Some primal part of his teenage brain was still aroused at the embrace. The old man that resided there was in full panic mode. After a brief war of wills, the old man won.


Nick found his words, "Aisha's right, I was going to break up with you. Sorry I didn't want to do it like this." He turned and walked into the building, heart hammering in his ears.


Well, that was awkward and every bit as terrifying as I thought it might be. Fuck me...


He made his way through the halls looking at all of the faces gliding by. Bit by bit he remembered the names that went some of them. He could not however remember either where his locker was or what his class schedule should be.


He made his way to the office through the jostling students. After waiting for a few minutes the office secretary called him forward.


"Mr. Starr, what brings you here this morning?"


"I forgot my locker combination."


"Mm-hmm," she said over pursed lips. She made a call while staring at him in a way that made his skin crawl. A few minutes later the janitor showed up to escort Nick to his locker.


At the locker, the janitor inserted a small key into the combination lock. He wiggled the key mumbling to himself. "Do you want to set your own combo?" He asked turning to Nick. " Go ahead. Start clockwise. Good, now go all the way past zero. Hmm, now straight to your third number and then step aside."


Nick did as instructed and the man turned the key back pushed the locker closed saying, "now try your locker." Nick repeated the sequence and the locker opened. "Thanks," he offered, and the other man waved back at him as he left.


Inside Nick found a geometry book 2, two notebooks, and an English-Russian dictionary. An old backpack and a raincoat were lying on the floor of the locker. He picked them up to hang them on the hooks and found a biology book and a book of American history.


The notebooks were "Civic Discourse & Debate" and "Writing". His class schedule was emerging through a haze. First period was either geometry or Russian. Then writing and biology, both of those were before lunch.


Or was one after lunch and one before? Shit.


Both Russian and geometry were on the north side of the school. He made his way there greeting people as he went. He was starting to find his rhythm.


Turning the corner to the north wing he stopped to debate whether to go upstairs. A familiar face disrupted his deliberation. Kenji Kaplin was a tall slender half-Japanese kid wearing a baggy surplus army jacket. He and Nick had been friends from freshman year until the end of Nick's life. Nick jogged a few paces to catch up to him.


"Kenji!" He called as he closed the distance. The other boy turned around with an eyebrow raised.


Damn! I don't think I'm ever going to get used to seeing people young again.


"Are you on your way to math class?" Nick continued.


"Where else would I be going?" Kenji still had his eyebrow raised. His head cocked in what they would later call the "don't trifle with me" expression.


"Man it's good to see you. You would not believe the crazy couple of weeks that I have had." Nick said falling into stride next to him. "So what are you up to, did you have a good break?"


"Dude what's your malfunction? Why you act like you know me? You don't know shit you don't even know my name fool." Kenji turned to leave still talking, "my name is Ken fool."


Nick took a few more jogging steps to catch back up. "Sorry, Ken, I forgot, my bad."


"My bad?" Kenji stopped, head following his eyes as he looked Nick up and down. "Look we got class with Mrs. G. that's true and you're dating my friend's little sister, Sarah right?"


"Yeah, I mean no. I broke up with her. I'm Nick. Anyway, I missed the last two weeks before the break I didn't take my books. Can you give me a rundown of what I missed?"


"Dude, not sure what you're getting at, but I'm not gay. So go ask the teacher and leave me alone." with that he turned entering the classroom refusing to look back in Nick's direction.


Holy shit, am I actually getting worse at this?


Nick followed him into the classroom. Rows of undersized combo desks faced the right side of the room. A short woman with grey shooting through her glossy black hair stood at the chalkboard, her back turned to the class. Nick made his way to an empty desk and squeezed his way into the built-in chair. a small wireframe basket under each chair was the only place to store items. a small bean-shaped writing surface wrapped around from the right. Nothing fit, and his irritation turned to brood. His malaise shattered, as knuckles clanged on the corner of his desk.


"Mr. Starr, can we have your attention please or is this boring you?" Mrs. G was about five feet tall, but that didn't stop her from looming over him. She filled his field of vision.


If I make it through high school I'm going to have to learn that trick.


His monologue did nothing to ease the vise-grip around his lungs.


"Yes Miss G. This is boring me, may I be excused?"


"Only if you want to go straight to the principal's office."


"That is exactly what I had in mind, thank you." He slid himself sideways out of the tiny chair picked up his book in his bag and walked out the door. An orchestral crescendo of "Oooh's" followed him out the door. Nick made his way to the principal's office and for the second time that day. The secretary watched him approach frown deepening.


"You again Mr. Starr? Don't tell me you still can't get into your locker?"


"No, not that. I need to talk to someone about changing my classes. Or better yet how to get out of here all together and into college."


"Since it is the first week of classes, you can talk to your guidance counselor about changing them. You may even be able to challenge a few of them." Her tone had softened and she leaned out to place a hand on his. You're not 16, you can't get out of school without involving your parents in the matter. Now, do you have permission to be here from your teacher?"


"I do. Can I talk to my guidance counselor?"


He watched her fingers pecked at the keys each stroke swift and deliberate. A moment later she looked up, "you can come back at 10 o'clock." She ducked under the counter for a moment and returned with a pick document. She scrawled Starr, N at the top and 10:00 – 10:30 on the bottom."You can use this to get out of class. Now, Mr. Starr, get back to class."


Nick did not return to class. Instead, he made an escape through the North exit on Salmon street and followed it east into the heart of the city. The quicksilver winter sky made him squint. He had to keep his head down to avoid the light drizzle that did little more than bead water on his brow. After crossing the overpass, he zigzagged several blocks to the corner of 11th and Taylor.


Across the street was the enormous Multnomah County Library building. 11th Ave. sloped away to his left. The building itself was dramatic, a near Gothic piece of architecture. Simultaneously resembling a medieval fortress and a cathedral. The bottom level was all smooth gray stone. The gray stonework continued up the sides and along the top like a picture frame. It surrounded a wall of bright red brick that occupied most of the building. Nine giant fan-style windows lined the bottom of that red brick. Another row of large square multi-pane windows lined the top under a huge inscription. It read; EDUCATION TRAVEL BIOGRAPHY MATHEMATICS ASTRONOMY CHEMISTRY.


A feeling of warmth bubbled its way from his gut to spread down his limbs as he stared at the library building.


It's a damn shame what we let happen. Even my kids never really got to experience this type of pilgrimage to a public library.


Savoring the site for a moment he turned around to make his way into the little coffee shop behind him


Leo's Coffee Shop was an honest-to-goodness drink your coffee at counter kind of shop. The kind which was all but extinct since the late 2010s. A white Formica bar ran the length complete with a 1950s style curved soda jerk station. Two old men in flannel shirts sat chain-smoking, sipping coffee and reading newspapers. A few spaces down a 30-something man with dental scrubs underneath a tweed jacket. He was sucking down the last of his breakfast.


Nick made his way to the far end of the room to sit down by himself in the shiny blue vinyl seat. His eyes stung and he forced himself to blink away the smoke. A Chinese man in an over-sized button-up shirt meandered his way down to greet him. Paper napkins and straws showed white against the blue of his pocketed shirt.


"Let me get a cup of black coffee and do you have any pie?"


"Pecan, apple, and cherry," he replied pulling a white porcelain coffee cup out of nowhere. He found a coffee pot and was filling the cup while asking, "my name is Peter. I don't think I've ever seen you here before. Do you go to PSU?"


Nick thought for a moment about his reply and decided it was best to play along. "Yes, I'm studying physics there. I'll have a slice of pecan pie. My name is Nicholas nice to meet you, Peter."


"Ahh, physics is good, you will have a good job." The man bobbed his head before setting the coffee pot back on the warmer. "Let me get that pie," he smiled moving over to a little window in the back. Nick could hear him speaking Mandarin to someone on the other side.


30 minutes later feeling refreshed Nick stepped out into the light drizzle. He had wasted more time than he intended to and now hurried over to the library.


Inside the massive entry hall, Nick scanned for the info desk. White marble floors and pillars reflected light from every angle. At the desk, the librarian directed him up the wide spiral staircase to the second floor. The limited self-paced education section of 1985 was disappointing. He found guides to taking the GED, the SAT, and the GRE. Taking them under an arm and made his way back downstairs. At the checkout, he paid a 75 cent late fee for "Healer" by F. Paul Wilson.


Holy crap I remember that book. That's the one with the brain parasite that talks. If it's still in my room, I'll have to read it again.


It was 9:45 when he checked his watch again on the way out. He shouldered his bag and made good time back to high school.


At his locker, he bent down to put the books away. A hand slammed the locker closed from behind. Nick swung around to see a young man with long blond hair pulled tight in a ponytail. His lean and angular features and high cheekbones pinched tight in a scowl.


"Clinton?" Nick asked as he finished standing. His shoulder knocked aside Clinton's arm and forced a back-step.


"Heard you been cheating on my sister. I thought you were better than that." Clifton Bonds glared up at him. His lunging two-handed shove bounced Nick's head off of the lockers. He angled his body to keep Nick pinned him to the wall.


Nick moved without thinking. His left hand came down hard inside Clinton's elbow forcing it to buckle. Leaning into the bent arm, he turned away from his right side and stepped out into the hallway. Overbalanced and facing the wrong way, a gentle push stumbled Clinton into the wall of lockers.


Clinton surged backward, red-faced, eyes wide as he took a wild swing with his right. The arm was opposite Nick's new position. With an almost casual motion, he slapped Clinton hard across the face before the fist made it halfway. The hallway erupted into primate sounds as people jostled to get a view.


Clinton had fallen to one knee and a white hand-print covered the entire left side of his blazing red face. "you're dead!" He screamed His eyes were brimming over. Hands reached in from all sides lifting him back to his feet. Somewhere someone yelled "fight!" Soon the crowd was chanting"fight! Fight! Fight!"


Nick pushed his way through the crowd ignoring the yells of "pussy", "faggot", and "chicken."


 What the hell is it with these kids and the homophobia? You would think the news was running stories about gay gang rape 24 hours a day.


Somehow he was still on time for his 10 o'clock appointment with the guidance counselor. The commotion was still audible as he slipped into the office.


45 minutes later he had a note from the guidance counselor excusing him from the rest of class on that day. It'd taken him 10 minutes to convince the guidance counselor that he didn't belong in high school. They'd worked out a plan which he would now have to get his mother to agree to. If it worked he would never have to return to the volatile emotional cesspit of high school.


No more rampant hormones. No children trying to embroil him in their daily drama.


He looked down at the folder in his hands thinking of the waiver letter inside. With it, he had early access to the SAT exams.


The hallways were clear and a sense of relief prickled like goose flesh across his neck. He returned to the locker and retrieved his things before making his way out of the school. He played the day back as he walked home.


A feeling of despair threatened to force him to his knees. The failure to reconnect with one of the most important people in his life felt permanent. He tried to put it out of his spinning head telling himself he could still fix it later. Unconvinced, he envisioned a chain reaction of missed connections. A new fear grew from the despair, that he would be alone and isolated for the rest of his life.


Back inside the apartment, he opened the cabinet over the refrigerator. Jack's hiding spot. Nick pulled from within it a bottle of old Jack Daniels Tennessee whiskey.


Filling a cup with ice he poured the whiskey over the top until there was no room left. Lifting the glass high into the air he toasted to the empty room. "Here's to the worst first day of high school in 60 years, may there not be another one for at least 60 more."
