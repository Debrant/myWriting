Sonny ripped the phone out of the wall and threw it hard over the balcony. It bounced twice and skidded into the pool. His cheeks burned in his eyes stung. He couldn't think, he needed to lash out at everything within reach. His body shook with the effort of control. He took a deep shuddering breath and stood up straight, swallowing hard.

He was still standing, staring out at the green grass between the house and the pool when Aimee found him. The rage still burned. His thoughts raced with a volume that drowned everything else out.

Startled, his heart skipped a beat as Amy stepped in front of him. She was mid-sentence, "hey, are you there?"

He forced himself to match her stare and his blood pressure dropping as he did. "What?"

"What's going on? Haven't you heard a thing I've said? Are you okay?"

The rapid-fire sequence of questions frustrated him, leaving him lost. The answers he'd formed for each preceding question evaporating with the new query. He stammered, "I, I don't know. Holland has him, he stabbed me in the back."

"What you talking about? Who does Holland have?"

"Nick, Holland has Nick. He just checked them in for testing and evaluation in Syracuse. How the hell did they get there so fast? I just talked to Holland yesterday." The skin of his cheeks prickled and his hands shook, but he was beyond caring.

She took him in her arms, "shh, easy, it will be okay. Come have a seat," leading him to the wicker chaise on the balcony and lit a cigarette for him, pressing it between his fingers. "You did this, not Holland, Nick is in custody because of you."

That got his attention, "what you mean?"

"Okay, you've suspected that Holland was playing both sides since I've met you. I thought you were crazy at first, but now I agree with you. I'm a behavioral analyst at heart and right now I think Holland is playing damage control. If Jack had attacked that cop, you would have taken Nick, right?"

"Yeah," he offered, wincing when it sounded weak and desperate to his ears.

"So Nick must know," she said while giving him an important and expectant look.

Something clicked, he saw it, "that I have Jack and the fact that he is in custody now is proof that they're working together. He ran straight to Holland, Holland didn't catch him."

"Exactly, but we can't call that proof, yet. We need more." The swirl of rage and shame gave way to indignation. Even that melted away as he watched Aimee. She would help make this okay.

The door to the adjoining room flew open with a clang, bouncing off of the wall. Darren Horne stood in the doorway. The big man had taken it upon himself to be Sonny's personal muscle ever since Vegas. After a quick read of the room, Horne cleared his throat. "Ahem, we've got a problem." Aimee must've delivered one of her piercing looks because Darren hurried to continue. "Eighth district judge Watkins has a warrant on his desk for 28 Audubon Pl."

"What?" Sonny shot to his feet while Darren shrugged. "Who the hell requested that?"

"Detective Vincent Taminy," Darren replied through clenched teeth.

"Is Watkins one of ours," Sonny asked, trying to remember why the name Taminy sounded familiar.

"He must be. Headquarters wants us out of here and on our way to Syracuse with Jack Starr, ASAP. Watkins won't sign the order until the morning." Darren reached out a steadying hand as Sonny swayed.

"I'm okay. Go pay the local talent and then pack the van. I want to be on the road before sundown." He glanced back at Aimee, who gave him a nod and a weak smile.

Behind him, Darren responded, "T minus 90 minutes and counting, sir." His heavy footfalls retreated into the other room, followed by his booming voice, "listen up and gather round."

Aimee anchored him with a gentle palm on his back. "This is good, remember you like Jack. Headquarters will sort everything out with the NOPD. You might use Jack as leverage with Holland. If not, we can manufacture an alibi for him and this whole New Orleans affair goes away. You've got to calm down, don't let the stress give you another episode."

He took a deep breath, "yeah you're right. We've got to get packed up, it's going to be a long drive. Can you come with us?" He hoped he didn't sound too desperate.

"Well, there isn't time to book a flight," she purred. "Plus, you're not supposed to be driving. So, Darren and I will take turns. We can be there by tomorrow night. You should contact your family on the way back? It couldn't hurt." Aimee wasn't a big fan of his family and took care not to bring it up, but she wasn't wrong. For the second time in minutes, he found himself thankful for her presence.

Horne's voice echoed through the back of the van, "hey folks, traffic is backing up. We are coming into Scranton and could jump off here, there's a great diner right off the next exit. We're almost 2 hours ahead of schedule as it is and if we wait an hour traffic should be clear."

Sonny shot a quick glance at Jack, assessing whether to bring him into public. The bruising around Jack's face made him look like a boxer, with two black eyes that turned purplish-green, a visibly swollen nose, and cracked lips. He should probably make Jack eat or at least get a milkshake, but didn't want Jack's sullen gaze mixing guilt into his meal.

"Sounds good, Darren, make it happen." Then turning to Jack he asked, "do you want me to get you anything?"

Jack refused to turn his head or acknowledge the question. He had been behaving like this the entire day. On one hand, Sonny understood a bruised ego. But on the other, jack seemed intent on blaming Sonny for everything. No self-awareness, no gratitude, no thanks for pulling my ass out of the fire, and no forgiveness. "Fine, I'll bring you a strawberry malt. You need some calories in your system or you going to pass out."

"Sorry hun, the Jim Crowley exhibit is open to walk through, but we only open that room for seating on the weekend or events. Can I get you a booth?" Linda, according to her name-tag, told Darren. Something about watching disappointment wash over that big mean bastard cheered Sonny up.

"Oh well, Terry's is still one of the best diners in the country," Darren told them as Linda walked away. "You guys should go check out the Crowley room before we leave. It's another two hours to Syracuse from here, assuming traffic lets up."

The diner was slow, and the food arrived in a hurry. They ate in silence, each lost in their own maze of thinking. After the meal and nursing a cup of coffee, Aimee turned to him and asked, "did you talk to your father?" Sonny nodded, saying nothing. "And what did he say about Holland?"

Sonny let a sideways breath, "nothing helpful. Randal Jr. is of the opinion that I should not go to the Council with this at all. According to him, it'll just look bad on my record."

"He doesn't think Holland is working with Nicholas Starr? Did he have another explanation? Did heâ€¦" Sonny held up a hand to stop her.

"Slow down, I can keep up when you get going. He said I was probably right about Holland and Starr working together. Sonny lifted his hands to perform air quotes. "You got outplayed son." Anyway, the Council only cares about results, and right now Starr is cooperating."

Darren looked around, uncomfortable, "Sonny, I got your back, but this conversation is way past my comfort zone. I'm going to get Jack some food and go back to the van." He stood up and began walking to the cash register.

"Darren, get him a strawberry malt and a patty melt, and thanks." He received a deep nod and then Horne was at the register ordering two strawberry malts and to patty melts with fries, Sonny chuckled under his breath. "No wonder he's carrying a gut." After a moment the smile faded and he turned back to Aimee, "he's a good guy, even if he acts like a jerk most of the time." He shrugged his shoulders as she squinted to study Darren still at the register, laughing.

"My dad had something else to say." He was hesitant to say it out loud. The last thing he wanted was to scare Aimee off.

"Which was?" She prodded.

"Dr. Blackwell was the one that issued the order to bring Jack back to New York, and he thinks that if she has access to him, it would be bad for me. Bad for the entire family. No, he wants me to kill him."

"He what?" She blurted with too much volume. The background buzz stopped as everyone turned to look at them. She continued in softer tones, "why would you do that?"

"To prevent Dr. Blackwell from gaining leverage over our family. She is ambitious and has been trying to force Randall off of the Council for quite a while now. Nothing overt, all behind-the-scenes. But she's made an enemy of both my father and my grandfather, and he's made it clear that he doesn't want me to hand Jack Starr over to her. I don't have a clue what to do," he admitted, setting down a terrible burden.

"Jesus, Sonny! You told me your family was ruthless, but I had no idea. I thought you liked Jack, you can't be considering this."

"I don't want to, but I'm feeling kind of trapped. Honestly, I could use some of that logistics and planning right now," he offered a weak smile.

"Okay, what if we split up? My home office is in Miami anyway, and I can smuggle him from there to stay with my uncle on his farm in Puerto Rico. You," she said with a heavy emphasis. "Don't offer any additional information, but we need to come up with a way to get Darren's buy-in without compromising his knowledge." She fell silent as she puzzled the situation over.

After a few minutes, she put her hand on his arm, "you need to tell Darren what your father said. Get him to cover for you with me, say you don't want to upset me, and have him drop me off at Wilkes-Barre." Her expression was full of frenzied excitement, her eyes wide, and she radiated readiness.

I wonder who would be more disappointed if I brought her home, mom or dad.

In normal circumstances, Sonny hated being outsmarted by women, especially a romantic partner, but in Aimee's case, it didn't bother him. He even found it kind of sexy, which was weird. "So then what?" He asked, trying to see where she was going.

"Are you familiar with any of the forest land between here and Syracuse?"

"Are you talking about Independence and Winona?"

She scrunched up her face while pursing her lips. It was foolish, but he hoped she thought the attempt cute at least.

"Those are both north, aren't they?"

"Yep," she answered smiling, "stop me when you recognize something." He nodded and leaned back to listen.

"Lackawanna, State Game 175, then 35 here in Pennsylvania. In New York off of the 81 you have Skyline, Whitney is no good, so James Kennedy State Forest. What else? Donahue?"

"What about Labrador Hollow?" Sonny asked, remembering a trip there with his Geology class during college. He even remembered the trip from Cornell, which took a section of Highway 81.

She paused, her smile broadening, "yes! That's perfect. Okay, here's the plan you ditch me, then have Darren take you to the hardware store to get landscaping cloth and some shovels. Stop at a liquor store too, tell Darren that you want to get Jack drunk, one last hurrah."

A grin spread over Sonny's face as he caught up to her. He took her face in his open hand and drew her into a kiss. She resisted for a second, then leaned into him. "What will you tell Dr. Blackwell?"

"I don't know, maybe I won't have to tell her anything. Dad told me to call him when it was done." A sudden wave of anxiety crashed through his elation. Was he really going to lie to his family? The callousness with which Randal Jr. Had told him to commit murder still had him unhinged. Holland's words pushed their way into his thoughts.

"Some in this organization worry more about remaining in the shadows than collateral damage. Even if that damage is the life of a few civilians or even an entire family."

"Hey, what is it? You look like you just saw a ghost," his imagination flashed on an image of Aimee staring with admiration at Holland when they first met.

"Just something Holland said when we were back in Portland last winter. We should get moving, when should I tell Darren?"

"Taken to the hardware store after you drop me off, and tell him when he asks."

The sun, low on the horizon, had already disappeared behind the rolling forest lands and cast everything in hunting pre-twilight hues. He and Jack had shared a few whiskeys together while they waited for Aimee, and now the comfortable warmth and soft sway of a pleasant buzz gripped him as he stared down into the grave. Two extra-large sleeping bags arranged on the bottom in a rough body shape.

Sonny pulled out the snub nose thirty-eight that Darren had produced soon after learning the plan. The serial number was filed off the side and black electrical tape wrapped around the handle. He aimed into the hole and squeeze the trigger three times before dropping the gun. He began shoveling dirt down on top of the lumpy form. Darren would head back as soon as the shots rang out, Sonny only had a few minutes to get the first layer there can up to hide the details of the lumpy bags.

Satisfied with his progress, Sonny stopped to catch his breath, noting with satisfaction the sound of approaching footsteps. He mopped his brow one time and then began shoveling again, this time much slower. On the other side of the ridge near the top, Darren Horne came into view.

Halfway down Darren called ahead, "I thought you were going soft on me. Sure as hell took your time about it."

Sonny suppressed a shudder at the big man's comments and forced himself to join in on the laugh as Darren picked up the second shovel and begin scooping dirt. "I didn't hear any crying or begging, not a single scream. He didn't see it coming, did he?"

He followed the script Aimee had given him, "Jack wasn't stupid, but he was arrogant. He convinced himself that I hadn't made up my mind or was just trying to scare him. The whiskey helped, he was a pretty fun guy to drink with." Sonny kicked the now empty bottle into the hole and leaned down to pick up the gun, "this looks disposable, did you want to back or should I throw it in with him?"

"Toss it," Darren replied, "there's no shortage of guns when we need 'em."

As he patted down the last layer of dirt Sonny turned to Darren, "you're driving, I'm a little tipsy, and I need to call Randall Jr."

"I figured as much. Why do you call him that? He's your dad, isn't he?"

Sonny threw his shovel in the bag, leaving it for the other man to pick up, and shrugged. "Because Randall senior is just Randall and the only thing he ever called, my dad was Junior. I think I started calling him Junior sometimes when I was two or three if I remember the stories correctly. Anyway, as funny as my grandfather thought that was, my dad just never answered to anything else."

He was still mad at Holland and irritated with his family, but knowing that Aimee approved of his actions left him lightheaded. After leaving the diner, she'd manufactured the disagreement that led to dropping her at the airport. It had all been part of the plan, but that hadn't stopped near sickening panic from turning his stomach when she yelled at him. Sonny was falling for her and that it would be a problem. He shouldn't, his family would never approve, and he tried not to think of what they might do if they learned how he felt. Not that he was about to come clean with them anytime soon.

If he was honest with himself, however, he was just as pleased with not having to pull the trigger on Jack. In the heat of the moment beating Jack, sated his anger, but he'd spent the next several days reliving it when he tried to go to sleep. Each retelling gripping his heart tighter until he admitted to himself that he'd fucked up. Aimee had walked him through that as well. It was all very confusing. Sometimes doubt woodworm its way into his mind, and he would wonder if she was poisoning him with her ideas and her ideals. He would resign himself to blow her off until the next time they talked.

Back in the van, Darren handed him the phone as they pulled out of the day-use parking lot. "You won't have any reception until we can see Highway eighty, but if it's all the same to you, I just as soon you call sooner than later. Where only twenty-five minutes out from the city and it's been a long day with me still need to find a room. Unless you want to offer me the spare room at your flat since Aimee is out of town?"

"You got a funny way of asking, but sure you can crash at my pad," he took the phone from Darren and waited for them to come out of the woodland area before dialing his father's number.

"Hello?" His father always sounded nervous or confused for as long as Sonny could remember, but he imagined growing up in the shadow of the great Randall Pera would have that effect on anyone.

"It's done, what do we tell Blackwell?"

"Don't tell her anything yet come straight to my place, are you alone?"

"No, Darren Horne is with me right now, I was going to let him stay at my place since it's too late to book a flight tonight."

"Did he help you get rid of Starr?" There was an accusatory note in the question.

"He helped me bury the body, whatever you're asking me if I made him pull the trigger for me, the answer is no."

"Good, bring him with you we might need backup for what's next."

"Randall, don't be cryptic, what's next?" He was sure that he would not like the answer to that question. Talons of ice were reaching for his heart again.

"When you hang up with me, you're going to call Carter Holland and tell him to meet you here. Tell them you can't bring Jack in for processing because I have an important task for you and that he is to meet you here and take the van back to headquarters and you will take his car to do what you need to do."

"When what are we supposed to do when he realizes we don't have Starr?" His heart was hammering in his chest, he knew what the answer was going to be. Although he dreamed of this moment many times, now that it was here, he wanted nothing to do with it.

"We, will not do anything. You are going to drive straight back to your place in DC after delivering a package to Randall senior's assistant. I'm sure your associate Mr. Horne will have no problem driving the van back to California, or at least until he can find some way to dispose of it and Holland's body."

"How are you going to spin that?"

"That is not something you need to concern yourself with. But if you need the solace of motive, then understand that not everybody is happy with either of our diversity projects. Stick to the plan. If Blackwell cries foul, she will find herself alone. Enough questions, do as you're told."

Sonny hung up the phone and Darren chimed in, "are we taking out Carter Holland? God damn!"

He gripped the phone as tightly as he could, afraid that if he didn't, his hands would shake. He tried to nod in the slide affirming way, knowing that if he spoke his voice might crack how had everything changed so much in a few short days. 2 weeks ago he pleaded with the Council for this chance, and here he was about to cry, what the fuck!

He shoved the emotions as far down as he could make them go and dialed Holland's pager number. He looked over at Darren and smiled, "assuming he plays ball and calls us back in the next twenty minutes."
