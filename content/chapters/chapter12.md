Nick was back at the library. He had been coming every morning for the last week. In the evenings he had been picking up shifts at the Market Plaza. Now he stared unseeing at the stack of index cards and loose papers on the table in front of him. He felt a heavy bone-deep fatigue that threatened to drag him under the table.


The first few days after getting his GED had been good, he had accomplished something. The excitement and determination to “do things better” fresh. But with every day that passed the feeling had lessened. The thrill was all but gone and now, a growing trepidation in its place.


There was an idea that pulled at the corners of his mind and tormented him. One that he could not shake. The idea that it wasn’t only high school that was boring and repetitive. That every aspect of his new life would feel much the same. That it would be lacking some essential kernel of the unknown that made life palatable.


He pushed the papers into a pile and swept the index cards into his bag. Shoving the pile in after the cards he zipped the bag and stood up. A new thought bubbling to the surface. Why?


Why was he trying to recreate his life? Why was he trying to be a new, better version of the same old Nick? Some part of him was holding back control, unwilling to live in the moment. He was afraid. Afraid to lose himself in the mass of emotion and swirl of teenage hormones. Afraid of the judgment of an old man that he was losing touch with by the day.


What I need is to forget, and to find people to talk to. So damn bored!


He looked to the door and caught a young woman staring at him from behind the stacks, she smiled when their eyes met.


No none of that! Not yet. We can't abide endangering people's lives for the sake of a thrill. Although, I don't much remember anyone caring in the 80s.

 Do you remember when the manager at the movie theater used to make us put things up on the top shelf? All just so she could ogle and talk about our ass.


 Well, no matter we can think about these things soon. What's with the we? Is this an admission that I am of two minds that stem from two lives?


 No matter, again, what was that lad's name? The one that used to hang out with Kenji when I met him, Luis? Logan? No Lucius, it was Lucius. The one that used to make fake IDs.


Okay, Kenji, let's give this one more chance, shall we?


With one last smile to the stacks, he made his way out of the library backpack bouncing with his renewed vigor. He would need money he thought as it began to rain. He slipped his arm through the other shoulder strap before setting eastward at a jog toward the waterfront.


Down on 1st Avenue, he made his way into the Portland Teachers' Credit Union. He withdrew $200 from a flirtatious teller in her late 20s.


What is it today? It's like they can smell the indecision.


He looked at the big digital clock on the wall next to the door. He had several hours to wait if he wanted to catch Kenji on his way out of school. He paused halfway through the glass doors when he saw his father on the steps across the street. He was talking to two well-muscled men in suits. They were taking shelter from the rain under the overpass between the two buildings. There was something familiar about them but he couldn't place it.


 I need a better view.


He turned around letting the door close behind him, waving the bank manager over. "It's pouring out there. Can I use the back stairwell to run up to the union offices real quick?"


With a nod and a smile, the manager opened the door to the stairs, "no problem Nick, no sense in getting even wetter."


Nick took the stairs three at a time until he reached the third floor. He made his way to the overpass moving as fast as possible without running. He did not want his footsteps to audible from below. The overpass connected the third floor of his building with the second floor of the fed building. It was a wide concrete walkway with waist-high faux marble railings and no roof, it was wet and empty.


He made his way around the last part of the railing and toward the top of the stairs. He could, he could just make out the voices below as they came into view.


I knew he looked familiar, that's Mr. Carter our weekend regular.


The darker man was in the middle of saying something, Nick strained to hear them. "...has nothing but good things to say about the work you've done so far Mr. Starr. I'm sorry if it seems like we've been deceiving you. You have to understand this is a matter of national security. We had to be sure of your loyalties before we made our next move."


"I understand completely agent Holland. It's been a pleasure working with agent Pera here and I'm happy to help in any way that I can. I just can't believe Nick has got himself mixed up in all this. I am a little bit curious though, will there still be a job opportunity after we clear this up?"


“Oh, I'm sure there will be," the man named Holland responded. He stretched out to shake Jack's hand, "the next step is easy, we need to get that boy in for testing. If he's been exposed we needed to do it sooner than later. The longer we wait the more complicated things will become. The nature of this testing will mean we keep to off-hours. Either in the evenings or on the weekend, as we did for you. When do you plan on seeing the boy again?


"I don't see any reason to wait for the weekend it's not like he's in school now. His friends and his job both take up his weekends so I'd just as soon get it over with now. I'll call his mother tonight and arrange to pick him up tomorrow afternoon. What time should we be there?"


"Agent Pera will meet you in the same spot I dropped you off at. Anytime after seven Page him when you know for certain."


"I can do that. Thanks again for trusting me with this, I will let you down."


The other man turned his body as he began to talk. Forced to duck back around the corner, Nick lost track of the conversation. A car door slammed below. Darring a look over the railing, he saw agent Holland making his way back up the steps. Nick turned and ran as fast as he could back to the other building.


He made his way back downstairs and decided to stop to talk to Ali and get a cup of Persian coffee. He found a newspaper sitting next to the bar and took it with him to a table. He flipped it open to the classifieds and started perusing vehicles for sale. After a few moments, Ali made it over to the table, smiling as he came.


"Nicholas, to what do I owe the pleasure today?"


"Ali my friend just taking respite from the rain. I was next door at the bank and decided to come in. But since I'm here would you sit with me for a moment?"


"Of course," he said while seating himself across the table. "What would you like to talk about."


"I will be leaving the city for a while. Very soon. I have a good friend Ali one that I know would do a very good job for you. I would ask him to offer his services so you do not find yourself shorthanded if that is okay with you."


"Nicholas, if something is wrong, if you're in some kind of trouble you should tell me. Did you know that I represented Iran.."


"In the Olympics? Yes I know you were a boxer, you have told the story many times."


"No Nicholas, I do not believe that I have." As the other man stared into his eyes he knew that he could not cover for the slip. So he ignored it instead.


"I am not in trouble, or at least not yet. But that is why I must leave. You have been more than a mentor to me and I am grateful. So what do you say? Should I send my friend your way?.


Ali steepled his fingers, face serene as he straightened his spine. When his head reached its apex he stared down his nose at Nick. "Yes, please send me your friend. But also remember my offer. You have the number for the restaurant it will always be the best place to reach me. Nick, I have friends all over the world, England, Korea, Germany, even India. If you find yourself in need, call me. You are family now. Enjoy your coffee, I must go back to work." Ali stood and drew Nick up into a firm embrace, then he retreated back to the kitchen and was gone.


Nick took a long pull of the thick brown liquid, savoring its bittersweet thickness. His eyes returned to the classified pages of the newspaper in front of him.


“No way!” He said aloud in his surprise. There in the middle of the page sat a familiar ad.




1980 CB 750 F3 $500 firm
Good miles, custom purple
Moving need to sell fast
Call Steve 255-5522


I remember this bike! Except I bought it in late August with my birthday money! It was not a guy though. His girlfriend? She said he'd been trying to sell it all year and nobody wanted to buy it because it was neon purple.


 That damn bike became my calling card. I'll never forget it. Well, this must be destiny.




Nick returned to the bank for the second time that leaving only enough to keep the account open. 90 minutes later he was meeting with a man named Steve. Steve wore a leather jacket with fringe down the arms. It was hand-painted with Native American designs on the breast and back.


 In the previous 1985, Nick bought the motorcycle from Steve's girlfriend. He had never asked why the bike was purple, he wasn't going to miss this opportunity this time.


"Steve, this is a great bike I love the color. But I have to ask you what made you paint this bike?"


"Prince. The movie purple rain specifically. Best damn thing I ever seen."


"You're kidding, wouldn't have pegged to you as a Prince fan. No offense intended."


“None taken, anyway my cousin painted up. It was supposed to be just like Prince's bike in the movie. I was going to get this big fairing for it, you know a cowling with a windshield and everything. Only problem is, my cousin's not a Prince fan. He never watched the movie and I got the bike back looking more like Barbie than Prince."


"Damn right, about Barbie and Prince that is. It's funny that you should say so, I was thinking of naming it the Barbie bike. Anyways, I'll take it. 500 cash."


"Thanks, kid, enjoy her," he said as he signed over the title. “Did you bring a helmet?”


“No, but I'll throw in an extra 20 bucks if you have one you can give me."


Steve waved from the parking lot as Nick pulled out onto Division Street. The rain turned his fingers into painful sticks and stung his face. In moments his coat soaked through and he was beginning to shiver. Nick’s smile however was contagious. Every driver and pedestrian he passed seemed to feel its glow. Most were still grinning in the mirror as they receded from view. He felt unburdened, his heart felt light. He was free, maybe for the first time since his health had begun to fail. Longer even.




Outfitted from head to toe in leathers, Nick pulled the motorcycle into a parking spot in front of the high school. He'd stopped at Doc Brown's Motorcycle Supplies on the way down to the high school. Apart from the new leathers, he had the bike fitted with travel luggage. Two slim black plastic saddlebags and a larger square case behind the passenger seat.


Students were beginning to pile out of the front doors of the school on the other side of the lawn. He leaned the bike onto the kickstand and settled onto the seat sidesaddle style one leg out on the curb. It wasn't long before he saw the group of familiar faces he was waiting for.


"Ken, Clinton, over here," he waved. As a group, they slowed together eyes locked on to him. "It's me, Nick. Come here I need to talk to you guys." He did his best to look non-threatening while stepping onto the curb. They approached him, Clinton lacking several steps behind the other two.


"What do you want?" Kenji asked stopping several arm spans away and outside of fighting range.


"Well, for one I want to apologize to Clinton." Nick cocked his head back and to the side making eye contact with the other boy over Kenji's shoulder. "Look Clinton both you and your sister caught me on a bad day. I didn't cheat on her. I am going to have to leave town for a while and I didn't want her waiting around thinking I would come back anytime soon. I was trying to figure out how to break up with her when she surprised me. Aisha was the one that filled in the details. Anyway, I'm sorry about what happened between us. Are we good?"


Clinton took two halting steps forward to stand next to Kenji, "yeah, sure. I'll tell Sarah."


Nick turned to Kenji, "that goes for you too, I was having an off day. My mom and dad have split up and I'm going to end up having to leave town like I said. You might not remember, but I know your sister Trina and I thought you and I had talked more than once already. So sorry if I came off a little strong. But I need a favor from you."


"How do you know Trina? What you want from me?"


"One thing at a time, never mind how I know your sister. What I need from you is an introduction to Lucius."


"Lucius? What does he have to do with anything?"


"Your friend does more than host your D&D games on the weekends. I need them for some of his other talents, I'd rather not say which."


"What's in it for me? Is he gonna be mad at me afterward?"


"He will not be mad, I'm going to pay him for his services. As for what's in it for you? How about a job?"


"What?"


"A job, Trina said you've been trying to find restaurant work. I'm leaving town and I told my boss that I would help find my replacement. From what your sister says you would be a good fit."


Kenji tilted his head and squinted his eyes and a look that screamed distrust. "My sister said that? Now I know you're lying, she never said anything nice about me in her life."


"Not true, she would never say anything nice to your face. But she brags about you to her friends all the time. I'm the same way with my brother. It's a thing, no one likes to admit that their bratty little brothers are cool. Anyway, I have," he paused to dig in his pocket. " I have my boss's contact information right here." Nick pushed the paper into Kenji's hands, "he's expecting your call. Now, do you think you can introduce me to Lucius?"


Kenji stared down at the piece of paper and opened it to read the name and phone number written there. He stuffed the paper into the front pocket of his jeans and looked up at the sky and then down to Nick's bike. "We could go there now. Can you fit two people on that thing?"


"Yeah, I have an extra helmet in the case, you can take this one." Nick handed him the helmet, "let's go Ken."


"Why is your bike purple?" He asked putting on the helmet.


"The previous owner was a Prince fan but didn't know how to color match. I got a great deal on it because nobody else liked the color." Nick got back on the bike and started the engine after retrieving the other helmet. "So where are we going?""






"So how do you know Ken?" Lucius asked as the door closed leaving him and Nick seated in the messy living room. There were computer parts and gaming consoles everywhere. Ashtrays and cigarette butts littered the floors and coffee table. Lucius was taller than Nick or at least he would've been if he stood up straight. He was a sloped-shouldered, gangly limbed young man with dark beady eyes and a buzz cut.


"From school, but your reputation precedes you which is why I asked him to introduce us. I need a new identity. I know you do fake IDs. And I know your sister's girlfriend works for 911 and so you can get, shall we say, recycled documents as well."


Lucius leaned forward in his chair and reached under the coffee table. "You're remarkably well informed. Are you a cop?"


Nick put his hands up, palms facing forward, "easy now. I'm not a cop. I found some trouble and I need to skip town ASAP. The more legit I am when I get where I'm going the safer I'm going to be."


"Doesn't explain how you know what you know." His hand remained under the table and he sat motionless eyes locked on Nick.


"It's not that hard to figure out Ethan," he paused for effect. " If you know where to look. The truth is your mom and my mom work in the same building, you might say their friends. Meanwhile, my friends say you're in your twenties and your name is Lucius. You host parties, sell fake IDs, computers, old Atari decks, and the like. But I know your name is Ethan and you're still seventeen. Your mom thinks your living with your sister and her husband, by the way. So can you help me?"


"As long as you don't go telling everybody what you know. I've got a rep to consider." The hand moved from under the desk to meet the other behind his head. "All right Nick, if you want real, it's gonna cost you and you don't get to pick your name." He pushed himself up out of the chair and paced into the other room gesturing for Nick to follow on the way by. The room was sparse, containing only a bed, a nightstand, and six two-drawer filing cabinets. He made his way over to the fourth one from the door and bent down to open it up. Inside were rows of the hanging binders you find in office file systems. Lucius was muttering to himself as he flipped through pulling out files here and there.


When he pulled out the fourth one he pushed the cabinet closed.
He returned to the living room and sat down throwing the files down onto the coffee table and gestured for Nick to sit in the chair opposite him. "These are the only ones I have that might work. We've got two dead and two missing," he leaned down to pick up the first folder.


"Let's see, Michael Bremmer missing since May 1981 age 15 at time of disappearance. He was five-foot-ten and one hundred fifty-five pounds at the time of his disappearance. Light brown hair hazel eyes. Don't know if anyone would notice that. "Only ever had a learner's permit and he would've turned nineteen this last October. Is that old enough? How old are you?"


"That would be old enough. Anything old enough to work is old enough, but I would prefer to be able to drink in all fifty states if you catch my drift."


Lucius nodded and threw the folder onto an empty spot and picked up the next one in the stack." Nope," he said immediately throwing the folder into the new stack and grabbing the next one. "Okay, Walter Dean Northrop died last year at age twenty-one in a motorcycle accident no less. six foot two hundred thirty pounds, brown hair, brown eyes, a little chubby." He held up the Oregon driver's license with the round young face pictured on it. "I guess Walter went on a diet," he said looking Nick up and down. "And plenty of people grow after 21 this could be your winner. There was no insurance claim filed. Chances are Social Security will not have a copy of the death certificate. $250 can get you the license in 30 minutes with a copy of the birth certificate. If you want me to get the Social Security card I'll need another week, maybe two and another hundred dollars."


Nick reached into the inner pocket of his leather jacket and pulled out the remaining cash. He counted out two hundred and forty dollars in twenty-dollar bills and stuffed the few remaining bills back into his pocket. "I'll take care of the Social Security card myself. I don't have any change and I'm getting a little light. 240 good enough?"


Lucius stood up. He withdrew a tri-folded piece of paper from the file and dropped the folder back onto the table. He waited for Nick to stand as well then handed him the license and the paper. "It's been a pleasure doing business with you Walter." He said as he took the money.


"Actually, it's Dean, my dad called me Walter, but I prefer Dean. The pleasures all mine Lucius." He gave a bow and wink before turning to let himself out of the apartment to the sound of Lucius laughing.
