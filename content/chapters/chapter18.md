The driver took I-10 from the airport to N. Claiborne Ave. The car rode in the shadows of the causeway until they reached Esplanade.  It was a wide dived street with the north and south lanes separated by a lush green park-like strip down the center.

Rows of live oak trees towered over the median, throwing shade out with their sprawling limbs. A dirt path ran between the trees, conjuring images of an older time. The palatial two-story homes with wide balconies held up by majestic columns added to the impression of age.

Many of the colorful buildings grew another floor as they rolled along the edge of the French quarter. The cab turned left down a narrow lane, leaving the white neighborhood behind. The Faubourg Marigny was a lively, if somewhat rundown, commerce center. The buildings still showed their French roots. The architecture looked nothing like the neighborhoods of Baltimore. Somehow the people made this place familiar to him.

Everywhere he looked there were black and brown faces smiling, laughing. They sat on their porches and watched the yellow cab roll by. The car continued, leaving the Marigny behind. They stopped in front of the only three-story building in sight. It’s fading green paint broken by a single red door. The driver turned around as if expecting Holland to tell them to keep driving. “dis wer yah wun?”

Holland paused with the half heartbeat took to translate the man’s thick accent, “it is, thank you.”  He paid the man who met him outside with his single travel case Holland made his way up the three steps to the small porch. There wasn’t any sign to identify the boardinghouse, but Holland knocked anyway. An ancient weathered man with folds of brown skin under his mane of white hair answered the door in an oversized and rumpled yellow suit. He studied Holland for a moment and smiled.

“Well, you mus be dat New York boy. Come on in den.” The old man looked frail, but insisted on taking the travel case from Hollad. “Got you on da third flo-ah, dinner served at six sharp.” Inside the door to the left was a steep staircase. The old man carried Holland’s bag, grabbing the railing as he crept up the stairs. “I also serve breakfast at six, but you be okay if you come down as late as seven.”

The air was thick, even inside of the home. Beads of sweat tickled his back by the time they’d climbed the second set of stairs. At the top, his bag sat in front of one of two doors. “M’name’s Clarence, you either find me or Mama Rose if you need anything.” They shook his hands, Holland unsurprised at how firm the old man’s grip was. Holland took the key, entered the guestroom, putting his bag down next to the bed before leaving.

Holland locked the door and stood at the top of the stairs to check his watch. It four hours and 15 minutes to be back for dinner. Feeling a little out of place in casual attire, smoothed his beige linen pants. He wore a plain white tank top under his light blue short-sleeved Guayabera shirt.

Outside, the air was heavy, the moisture clinging to his skin as he pushed through it. People in New York complain about the humidity during the summer. New Orleans in May had it beat hands down. Rivulets of sweat tickled the middle of his back by the time he returned to the Marigny.

It was time to get to work. Holland memorized the layout from the 9th ward to the Garden District before coming. But studying streets on paper differed from walking them. He needed to get a sense of the city, the CIA operative in him taking hold of his mannerisms and helping blend in. With any luck, he would find a few clues before dinner.

Four hours later, Mama Rose radiated contagious energy as she showed him to the dining room. She was a tall and large woman of generous proportions. She was telling him they were waiting on the newest guest and asking them how his first hours in the city had gone. “Oh, now here he is. Mr. James, I would like you to meet Mr. Farouq. He’s across the hall from you, just got in today the same as you.”

Ahmed Farouq looked nervous, and Holland was sure that not all his sweating was from the humidity. “Nice to meet you, Mr. James,” he stammered.

“Likewise Mr. Farouq, a pleasure,” he turned to Mama Rose. “are we the only two guests right now?”

“For tonight, dear. Come tomorrow, we have another single gentleman and a couple checking in for jazz fest. Now it’s time to eat if you would take your seats, we may say grace.”

Afterward, Holland thanked Mama Rose for her hospitality and excused himself for the evening. Upstairs in his room, he pulled open the storm shutters and stepped out onto the balcony to sit down with his back to the street. 10 minutes later, Farouq came through the adjoining door.

“It was good to see you loosen up over dinner, I thought you were going to pass out for a minute,” Holland teased. “Sit over there on that side just in case.”

“ I don’t know how I let you talk me into this. If they find out I’ve taken the relic, it would be the end of my career.”

“Did you follow my instructions?”

“I may spend most of my time in the lab, Mr. Johnson, but I am not an idiot.” He was smiling now, “do you think he’s here?”

“I do, and I think I know where to look. Our scheduled rendezvous is in a little under 48 hours. We meet him at stage 3 at 4:30 PM the day after tomorrow. At least that’s what his postcard said. Me risking my career on this is one thing: I need to figure out what he’s up to if I’m going to risk yours. I have already made a circuit of the French quarter and picked up a few contacts and a lead. Remind me to thank Delgado for her insight if we get the chance. She’s a sharp one.”

“So what do I do in the meantime?”

“Go to the festival, have some fun. That music and distance is coming from President Steamboat, they have three stages in there. When was the last time you enjoyed a simple night out? This is not like Iran before the revolution. You don’t have to worry about who sees you, and no one is going to hold it against you. Plus it is part of your cover story and you have a poster of Stevie Ray Vaughan in your office.”

“Then why the secrecy Carter?”

“You are an important scientist and your activities and whereabouts are indeed being monitored. But the secrecy is not to hide what you are doing from anyone. No one back at headquarters knows we met in seventy-seven. That op was so dark it’s not even in my CIA file. But just because there’s no connection on the surface doesn’t mean that people won’t ask questions if it gets out that we’re meeting off mission. Of course, there’s the unauthorized removal and transport of the relic, but that’s a different issue. So I can tell my words are not relaxing you the way I had intended. I’m going to go. You should too.”
“Is Stevie Ray Vaughan playing tonight?”
He stood up to leave, giving his friend a nod and a smile that he hoped was reassuring. In the lazy daytime city, everything slowed the soup-like air. In the darkening skies of night, the city felt alive. People walked with renewed energy as the temperature cooled and the humidity receded. Holland knew the city was dangerous after dark but, he couldn’t help feeling the thrill of excitement.

Sounds of jazz, blues, or rock ‘n’ roll spilled out into the streets. The ambiance shifting every few hundred strides as he strolled from one music biome to another. Everywhere there were parties, the people’s faces and fashion changing with the music. Holland made his way through the sights and the sounds of lower Decatur Street. He stayed the path taking it through the open-air French Market watching people haggle as they shopped amid the aroma of seafood and spice.

At Jackson Square, he turned up St. Peter, the cobblestones underfoot uneven and combining with the growing stench to leave Holland on edge. The further away from the river he walked, the worse the smell became. It was a heady mix of rot, mildew, flowering plants, and sewage that overpowered the senses and had him feeling a little queasy. On his earlier outing, he had rubbed shoulders with many of the locals and pretended to be a motorcycle enthusiast everywhere he had found one. Getting people to talk was easy, getting them to reveal what you wanted, required a little finesse.

Holland’s best lead revolved around a custom Honda 750 Super-Sport. Customized with big knobby all-terrain tires and a bare-bones almost military style, it stood out as unique. He found it sitting next to the newspaper stand in front of Verti Marte Deli. Everyone inside knew the bike’s owner.

“You’re out of luck with that one Mister, Dean loves that bike. Does all the work on it himself. He pays the owner 100 bucks a month the park it there just because the delis open twenty-four hours and you can see it from the counter.”

“Sounds like this Dean guy knows a lot about bikes. Maybe he would know where I might get one like it or even help me customize a different one if I bought it. How can I get a hold of this guy?”

“Man, you could just wait right here until he comes back. Or go down and see him at Pat O’Brien’s. He tends bar there three nights a week.”

Ahead lay the world-famous Pat O’Brien’s, his destination. A tingling sensation that went hand-in-hand with tracking down a lead prickling the skin along his scalp. The Super-Sport leaned into the curb across the street in front of an all-night diner. Two hundred feet further on throngs of people milling about on Bourbon Street. He held back from moment taking a good measure of the landscape. The broad red structure was wide and looked squat despite the building’s obvious height.

Overhead, an ornate black wrought-iron railing kept guests from spilling over the long balcony. There was a line to one side of the doors of Pat O’Brien but he noticed people were walking into the building without waiting.

He noticed a group of black tourists walking toward the entrance and fell in behind them to blend in. Their accents sounded like they were from Chicago. One man ran to the front of the line asked the doorman, “how long is the wait for the piano bar?” He and the doorman whispered for a few moments before shaking hands. When the man returned to his group he said, “come on, let’s go get some hurricanes in the main bar while we wait, we are on the list now.”

The group walked around the line to squeeze through the front doors, Holland tucked in behind them. Inside, the all brick carriageway double doors opened on both sides. At the far end, a massive staircase before a large open garden courtyard. The doors on the right opened into the piano show. On the left was a smaller neighborhood-style bar. A dozen small tables hugged the walls and a traditional wooden bar ran the length of the room. Holland was still standing behind the small group from Chicago when he saw the bartender. Dressed in a green bowtie and matching apron over a white button-down, Nicholas Starr appeared in his element. He carried several conversations at once while moving with a rapid but fluid grace. His smile never left his face, and he was out working with the other bartender.

Nick’s expertise clear by the scores of drinking patrons clustered on his end of the bar. It was easy to understand how someone like Sheriff Smith put so much faith in the young man. Holland couldn’t quite wrap his mind around it. He continued to stare as Nick sold two or three drinks for everyone that his older coworker seemed to push across the bar.

He looked different as well. His hair had grown long, was flung out around him in a wild mane that reached for his shoulders. His slender arms now corded with new muscle. Still intent on his analysis, he almost missed noticing that the tourist had made it to the bar, leaving him exposed. He stepped out of the doors as Nick’s greeted them.


Out in the courtyard ordered an Irish coffee, all the while staring at the entrance to the bar one hundred feet away. His gooseflesh’d skin transitioning from hot to cold. His brain was still stumbling over the near impossibility of the scene. No one, no matter how talented, could pull off what he had. Arrive in a new city land a competitive job with no work experience. Then within three months perform it with a master’s level skill.

He kept turning the replayed the scene in his head the other bartender looked to be in his 30s and had been showing signs of frustration. In the brief moments that Holland had stood and watched from the doorway, he’d witness him glance at Nick with admiration several times.

He’d finished two coffee drinks before he realized he was still brooding. He pulled his mind away from reflection and waved the server over. “How late is the bar open?”

Five and half hours later, Holland sat in the window of the all-night diner. The last of the tourists left the bar across the street and the doorman shut the gates. Years of training and a four-hour nap had fought off most of the tiredness. A hot cup of black coffee with chicory was helping ease the rest. This type of thing had been easier in his 30s, he mused as he ate a breakfast of eggs and grits.

Four men, two white and two black, were walking across the street all but arm in arm. They all wore white shirts and pants and looked for all the world like the beginnings of an ice cream truck drivers convention, Nick was among them. The other white man was the bartender Nick had been working with, and he knew the other two were servers from the short sleeve shirts. That, and the fact he hadn’t seen any black bartenders in the city yet. When the quartet entered the diner, they doubled the patronage, bringing with them a new atmosphere.

The four straddled stools at the counter where Viking-sized goblets of Budweiser waited for them. The openly gay server prattled on about how handsome they all were and how happy he was to have something to stare at. They ordered hamburgers and settled into a mellow conversation. Holland strained his ears, attempting to pick up what they were saying.

“You going to come to church with us on Sunday? Mama said we should let you play basketball with us if you don’t come, it’s a tradition.” The young man speaking wasn’t much older than Nick. Eighteen or nineteen years old, at least as tall if not taller than Nick in twenty or 30 pounds heavier. He had a round cherubic face and a flashing smile that Holland imagined would make him hard to dislike.

“Tell your mom I’ll come to church, you know I’m not gonna miss playing ball. The reverend doesn’t like it when I drive the motorcycle to church, so I’m going to have to meet at your place. Might as well come for breakfast.” The two burst out laughing and didn’t stop until they were out of breath.

Amidst the laughter, Nick turned back over his shoulder to check on his bike, eyes falling on Holland. A grin pulled the corner of his mouth up and he nodded. “Chuck, I’ll see you on Sunday morning right now I have a go talk to that gentleman over there. A friend of mine from up north. Hey Jack,” he yelled at the server. “This is all me, but bring mine over there.” He pointed toward Holland’s table is a picked up his beer and silverware and moved to sit down across.

“So how do you find New Orleans?”

“Other than the smell, I quite like it.”

“It’s surprising how fast you get used to that. Should’ve known you would track me down before the show.” He paused for a moment as the server, Jack, set a burger and homemade potato chips down in front of Nick. “You need to know that I’m going to watch Run DMC on Saturday. That’s non-negotiable, I never got to see them the first time around, I’m not missing them again.”

“I don’t know what any of that means other than your not going to be available on Saturday afternoon.”

“Carter, now you’re going to come with me. Because someday I hope you have kids and you’re gonna want to tell them you were there at the beginning.” He took a big bite of his burger grease dribbling down past his fingers and back onto the plate while he made contented noises over his chewing. After swallowing he continued, “so did you bring it?”

“I did.” Holland couldn’t move past the paradoxes he was seeing. “Look, Nick,” Nick coughed at that and shook his head. “Okay, Dean, I need to know a few things before we continue.”

Recovered from his coughing fit, he took a bite of his burger, staring at Holland and chewing. “What you want to know?”

“First,” Holland gestured with his thumb out, “who are you? I watched you earlier tonight, tending bar like a professional with twenty years experience.” Holland bounced his hand while extending the forefinger to mimic counting. “Plus, you took down two agents while unarmed in a busy casino and got out with anybody stopping you. How do you explain that, I’ve met some pretty rough-and-tumble teenagers in my life, but none of them could pull this kind of shit off?” Now that he had verbalized what had been building up inside of him, he leaned back, pushing his plate to the edge of the table. Relieved and drained at the same, waiting for Nick to respond.

They stared at each other, neither one saying anything for several long moments until Jack returned. “Damn! Is this a love connection going on? Dean, if I’d known you swung that way, I would’ve been all over you already. Or do you only go for,” he ogled Holland. “mmm-hmm, well that’s some fine chocolate. I ain’t mad at’cha.” As Jack retreated, Nick let out a hearty chuckle.

“All right, Carter. By my count, I’m seventy-six years old, and from what I’ve been able to piece together so far that relic has something to do with why I’m now stuck living in my past.” The words seemed to bounce around Holland’s mind like a ricocheting bullet. The implications of what he just heard seem beyond his ability to grasp, and yet somehow it seemed to be the only explanation that made sense. All the pieces fitting together like a puzzle.

He had dozens of more questions and opened his mouth to voice them, only to close it again. After several attempts, Nick took pity on him and continued. “It’s almost like you expected that answer. Before we continue, I just want to say sorry about your guys. Nothing went according to plan, and I almost didn’t make it out of there. But hey, I also want to say thank you for getting Danny and Jeannie back home, I appreciate you are a man of your word. I hope there are no hard feelings about knocking out your guys like that.”

“You did more than knock out Sonny Pera. You gave him one hell of concussion and a couple of days under medical observation. Not to mention a black mark on his reputation that allowed a hard time living down for years. It’s the kind of story people like to retell, a guy like Sonny getting his ass handed to him by a teenager.”

“Well, he didn’t give me a lot of options. That’s one tough son of a bitch, I’ll tell you that, strong too. He damn near had me twice. Anyway, something tells me he needs a dose of humility. Now, where were we? Oh yeah, 2046. Prostate cancer metastasized through my entire body. I tried to fight it, it won. Next thing I know it’s December 2, 1984, and I am.” He held his hands up in looked down at his body gesturing.

“December 2, that’s when we picked up the anomaly.”

“Yeah. By the time I figured out there might be something out there, you and your team and already moved in and cleared the area. So here we are, I have a vested interest in what the hell that rock does. I’m guessing no one else has made it do anything.”

“Not quite, it does the same thing for everyone. Sends out a quick sequence of radiation bursts, then goes dormant. One of the lab geeks back home thinks it’s implementing a handshake protocol, like a modem.”

“Interesting. If you first registered the anomaly on December 2, why didn’t you get it until after the fourteenth? And how far away from where you or your instruments rather when you registered it?”

“We’ve got sensor stations all over the country, all over the world. The group that I work for has been looking for one of these objects for a very long time. I don’t know where they pick the signal up first or how far was. From what I understand, the original signal lasted for fifteen minutes, long enough to triangulate. After that, it turned semi-dormant. We scoured the areas around the Oregon-California border from the air. We never found the signal. A pilot spotted a perfect circle melted in the snow after the storm right before we gave up the search.

“One of these objects.” He repeated. “Before we’re done, you’re going to need to explain who it is you work for. So how are we going to activate this thing ourselves without setting off more of the same alarms?”

“I brought someone with me to handle that.”
