Sonny Pera was in a bad mood as he leaned against the cream-colored stucco wall of the McDonald's. He stared out across the six lanes of traffic on the Las Vegas strip as he dug in his jacket pocket for a cigarette. Everything in this city looks shabby during the day. Without the bright lights to distract your eye layers of city dirt desert dust stand out everywhere. Across the street, the Silver City marquee showed sunbleached and rife with cracks and rust spots. Sonny managed to get his cigarette lit while holding a cup of coffee in his other hand. He took a long deep drag reflecting on the past week.


The day after Holland's meeting with the Sheriff had set off the chain of events. They spent a long busy day compiling a list of possible contacts across three states. Sonny had to admit a growing if not grudging respect for Danny Avery. His contacts in the Los Angeles area were a who's who of influential personalities. Writers, politicians, actors, and lots of law enforcement. Not that would ever admit it to Holland but the man was right about releasing the Avery's.


The following day Sheriff Smith called for Holland as the team ate lunch. Sonny had taken the call in Holland's absence. Smith had been ready to trade for the Averys release. A recording that would confirm Nick's location in exchange for their release. He tried to get Smith to drive to the safe house, but the old sheriff was too cagey. Holland had stormed in to take over the call and the sheriff had come right away.


Holland and Smith’s newfound repartee made Sonny uncomfortable, but it had served them well. . Even knowing that it was for the best it still had made his stomach burn to watch the Averys drive away. The team stood in the doorway of the staff entrance as Smith followed the Averys out of the compound waving.


As soon as the front gates swung shut they became a swarm of activity. Delgado took the cassette tape from Holland rushing off to her equipment. Holland had jumped on the phone with HQ to track down the phone number. He had watched with a feeling of envy for a while before sneaking off to drink with the tactical squad.


 Sonny had stumbled into the event center the next morning feeling groggy. Evidence of all night work was everywhere. A map of the Las Vegas strip tapped over one of the chalkboards. Next to it was a hand-sketched layout of a casino complex. He passed tables filled with crisp printed pages in neat labeled stacks. Hotel Security. Known Mob Affiliates. Informants for the Gaming Commission. The stacks covered two round tables big enough to seat eight. He wondered if he had been the only one to get any sleep.


While Sonny had slept Holland had traced the number to the Stardust Casino and Hotel. One of 1400 or so numbers all of which would ring the main desk if called from outside the casino. Aimee Delgado was able to pinpoint which phone using the background noise. Something about spatial sound analysis, it was hard to concentrate on what she said.

As it turned out there was plenty of surveillance information available to them. The Stardust Casino was in what looked like its final days as a mob-run joint. The casino years of investigation and round after round of indictments. The current leaders, Herb Tobman and Allan Sachs, were the latest to get caught skimming. The Gaming Commission was forcing a sale to the Boyd family in yet another change of leadership. Everything that they had requested and more, given with pleasure. The agents on the scene happy to gloat about their victories.


Standing in front of the chalkboard Holland had joined him. Handing him a cup of coffee and wasting no time started going over the plan. On the board, Sonny noted the locations of the exits, security rooms, and cameras. Holland had finished, Sonny recalled, with an offhanded comment. “Come on smile Pera, I thought you out of all of us would be happy about Vegas.”


They had flown from the single strip airport by lunchtime. The white hangers clustered around the end of the runway looking like a daisy as they lifted in the air. Sonny had tried to talk to Aimee had fallen asleep as the plane took off. Darren Horne, the tactical squad's big sergeant had laughed at the scene. “Damn Pera, you're so smooth you put Delgado to sleep,” he laughed out loud at his own joke.


Vegas had been fifteen degrees warmer than southern Oregon, but it felt like more. The sun that had been hiding behind the mountain clouds for days beat down on them from a cloudless desert sky. An unruly gang of feds had met the ten of them on the tarmac. Holland had an intense muffled conversation with the group's leader as they drove to town. They drove straight to a set of suits at the Stardust in the Jupiter arm of rooms.


Sonny put out his cigarette and finished his coffee. The mobile command van sat in the corner of the parking lot looking south. It was too large, the blue panels too clean by far not to stand out. Sitting a few hundred yards north of the casino on a Saturday afternoon. They had already received any number of inquisitive stares as they came and went from the van.


If our target wasn’t a fucking kid I would think that Holland had lost his edge. Still on the table after the cluster-fuck that Wednesday turned into.


Wednesday had been a mess. They had each had their roles to play, the six from California each at an exit. Delgado and Sonny the CC-TV system from the back office of the casino. Edwin Sharp was Rickie Cunningham look-a-like and the head of security. His flirtatious banter with Delgado made Sonny want to punch him in his ginger face. The fact that she had seemed to enjoy it made him sick to his stomach.


They had been in their positions by 10 am. Six hours had felt like an eternity staring at the closed caption tv screens. Sometime after four Holland took a call from Smith. He asked if they had taken Nick into custody after he had talked to the sheriff earlier. The kid, as it turned out, had been in the casino the entire day.


Later, after hours of watching grainy camera footage, they had found him. He had played poker in the morning. Had lunch in the buffet at 11 then returned to play craps before using the phone in the player's lounge at 1 pm. He had returned to play blackjack for an hour before leaving around two. On the way out strolling boldly as daylight passed Zack Fry. Darren had berated the junior agent in front of everyone when they watched the playback. Sonny had good laugh at Zach’s expense with the big man, all the while wondering if he could take Darren in a fight.


Darren Horne was a big Viking of a man. He was tall and muscular with mountainous shoulders thick limbs. He was also carrying more than a little extra weight around the middle. More so than the last time they had worked together, back in April 1983. Sonny had been in San Diego to help assist with a raid on the other side of the border. Officially, he went to assist in a raid on a cartel stronghold. The stated goal to seize several hundred pounds of cocaine before it entered the country. It had been one of Sonny's first assignments through the back channels of the cabal. Darren Horn was ATF but moonlighted as a mercenary for hire. He had been Sonny's contact inside the group. Their real purpose had been to kidnap an Argentine chemist with ties to Nazi scientists.


Horne had shown a vicious streak that Sonny could appreciate. He had been almost gleeful to hand out intense beatings during the raid. He also remembered how winded Horne would get in the process.


If it came to it Sonny knew that he had no chance against the bigger man on his feet. That suited him fine. He had been a two-time high school state wrestling champion. At Iowa State, he had been team captain under both Harold Nichols and Dan Gable. taking the Division I championship for each coach. Horne might outweigh him by 40 or 50 pounds but Sonny was certain that he could take him on the ground.


Sonny reached the van and gave a tap-tap bump tap-tap before opening the back doors. Inside Allen Lee was fiddling with the camera that faced south out of the front windows. Delgado was sitting in front of a wall of electrical equipment. Six small black and white television screens in two rows of three. Each with a different view from inside of the casino. Another two on the wall between the front and back of the van displayed views of parking lots. Delgado looked up for a moment when he came. She returned to her screens and pushbuttons without comment.


She was wearing the off-white skirt suit again. The warm brown tones of her skin drawing his eyes as he shut the door behind him. He had been unable to draw her out into a conversation much less get her into bed. Which was beginning to frustrate him to no end. He couldn't figure her out. She went out of her way to look good but seemed completely uninterested in men. Unless you counted that boob that Edwin Sharp, but Sonny had to believe that had been a team play on her part. No, he was beginning to think that she was a lesbian. He wasn't convinced, but what else could explain her lack of interest in him.


He stood stooped over in the back for a long moment. There was a thin walkway of space behind the two chairs in front of the displays. He took the empty chair next to Delgado and asked, "Is everyone in position?"


Lee looked back over his shoulder, "almost ready on my end. Amy hasn't done the check and yet, we were waiting for you." There was a hint of emphasis on the word of waiting. The tone of voice and his pinched-up face brought color to Sonny's cheeks. He forced down the spike of irritation. Holland had left him in charge, but no one seemed to be ready to accept his authority. Holland wanted Sonny to return to Medford after Wednesday. He said they needed someone there to call back if Nick contact.


Sonny had argued against his leaving even as he had agreed they couldn't count on the sheriff. To his surprise, Holland had agreed to go in his stead. He had taken Cummings and Fry, who was still fuming over the public shaming and went to watch Sheriff Smith. The two of them would man the bugs and wiretaps placed in Avery's cabin. Holland planned on spending the day with the sheriff to prevent any delay of information.


Before leaving Holland had taken the extra measure of calling in another squad. With so many agents working in peripheral roles in the city, it had been easy to form up another six-man team. Sonny had a dozen people to coordinate. The fact that none of them seem to respect him was, in part, responsible for his bad mood. He turned to Delgado, "all right then make it happen.


“Alpha team report," she said into the microphone. There was a half-second pause before the grainy speaker in front of her responded. With two men missing from the first squad, they had made two five-man teams.


Horne, North entrance."


"Livingston, high limit lounge."


"Wallace, valet."


"Lee, North Van."


 "Hess, poker."


Sonny watched the knit fabric strain against Delgado's body. She leaned into the microphone. "Bravo team report." He had to force himself to look away to maintain concentration.


"Davenport, Keno."


"Ingram, slots coin redemption."


"Paul, main bar."


"Mullen, West entrance conference center."


"Fowler, South entrance hall."


Sonny stood up to look at the map of the casino playing back everyone's locations. He put in his earpiece and turned on his mic. "Horne, move to the west wall near the sportsbook. You should still be able to see the entrance but now you should be able to see the baccarat and poker rooms as well." He waited for a moment.


"Livingston, move to the tables north of the high limit lounge. You should be able to see keno, high limits, and table games from the north. Ingram, make sure that you're watching the Players Club that's where Starr made the call from last time. Wallace, the kid isn't using the valet, move to the lobby bar. You should be able to see down the hall to slots. All right this could be a long day gentlemen, stay sharp."


Sonny looked at the command clock as he turned around to sit against the console next to Delgado, 8:53 AM. Starr had entered the casino a little after 10 on Wednesday and they hadn't set up in time to spot him. If today went off according to plan... If he was the one that brought Starr in, his days of reporting to Holland would come to an end. If Starr proved able to activate the relic? Sonny might skip right to the inner circle on the spot. The coffee wasn't sitting well, his stomach was turning over and over. He leaned his head back to take a deep breath.


Delgado pulled him back to reality, "are you okay?"


Sonny looked down at her forcing himself not to get caught eyeing her cleavage. "Yeah, just don't want this kid slipping through our fingers again."


"Good, could you not sit on that." She half swatted him off of the edge of the console, "thanks."


Sonny felt his cheeks burning as he made his way back out of the van closing the doors behind him.


God damn it, Delgado, why do you have to be such a tease?


Sonny made his way across the parking lot and onto the casino grounds, it was time to start making his rounds.


After three hours of pacing, Sonny stopped at the sportsbook to talk to Darren. "I'm thinking about rotating through everyone's position. 15 to 20 minutes each? Just enough time to get to the golden arches for a bite. Do you want to…"


"We have eyes on a possible target, standby for details," Alan's voice in his ear interrupted him.


Delgado picked up where Lee left off, "target is parking in front. We have a white male approximately 20 to 25 years of age. Dark hair sunglasses with a mustache. Sonny the mustache looks like it could be fake. He's headed toward the main entrance, Wallace you're up in four, three, two and opening the door."


"Copy, I have eyes on. I can't confirm, he's made a sharp right turn into slots. Should I follow?"


"Wallace, stay on him and give us updates," Sonny's heart was racing. "Stay here don't let any mustaches through this door," he barked at Horne." Sonny began a fast walk toward the table games hoping to get sight of the slot machines on the other side. "Everyone stay on your entrances".


"Wallace here, target is about 20 feet in front of me and walking slowly. He is keeping to the west side of the main hall. We should be coming out of slots in about 60 seconds."


"Livingston there and cut him off. If you're 5% sure it's him you and Wallace grab him." Sonny could see Livingston's back as he stood up and headed toward the west side of the hallway. He doubled his pace earning a few angry stares and comments as he jostled people out of his way. Ahead lay the green expanse of side-by-side craps tables. He took a path around the empty one. The other table's raucous crowd was spilling into the aisle.


Sonny was breathing hard by the time he got to the lounge where Livingston waited. "Where are they," he demanded. They scanned the crowd ahead and the wall of slot machines on the other side of the blackjack tables.


Livingston shrugged his shoulders, "they haven't come out yet."


Sonny tried not to scream into the radio, "Wallace status update." Sonny could feel every heartbeat in his chest reverberating through his entire body. He could hear the blood rushing in his ears as he stalked toward the slot machines. He motioned Livingston to follow him. "Wallace status update," he repeated. Silence.


The slot machines filled the entire width of the hall. You either wove your way between them or took one of two narrow paths along the walls. Slots were the darkest area of the casino. He motioned Livingston towards the east wall and made his way down the west. Passing down one bank, they met eyes at the end and continued. Two banks, he could see the bathrooms now behind Livingston. The edge of the coin redemption area to the right of the bathrooms. Livingston shrugged.


Halfway down the third bank of slot machines, Livingston's voice broke over the comms. "Wallace is down. I repeat, Wallace is down."


Sonny broke into a run toward the front entrance. Now he was yelling into the comms, "Lee give me eyes on that motorcycle."


"Still there boss."


"Keep watching," he snapped back. Sonny rounded the last slot machine and had a wide-open view of the front doors. Several large men in suits were coming his way, casinos security. He ran at top speed yelling, "FBI" while waving his badge at the men. Sonny broke through the front doors and into the glaring sun. He stumbled, blinking back tears and scanning the parking lot. "I'm outside, which way to the motorcycle?"


Delgado chimed in, "take a left the bike will be a few hundred feet or so before the entrance to the gaming floor. It's parked at the end of the second row back from the building. I see you now. A little further... you should see the bike at your two o'clock."


Still scanning for the bike, his attention jumped to someone moving toward him. They locked eyes. Sonny knew three things right away. The first was that the mustache was definitely fake and the second was that this was Nick Starr. Third, the was no mistaking the look of recognition on his face


There was a little less than 75 feet between. Sonny saw Nick's eyes dart toward the bike. In one fluid motion, he unbuttoned his blazer with his left hand and pulled his gun with his right. Nick turned was halfway to the casino doors before Sonny even completed the motion.


"It's him, it's him, he's running through the entrance to the gaming floor right now. Livingston, Horne get there, get eyes on him, I want him now." He ran as hard as he could. The leather shoes sending shockwaves with every heel-strike. His teeth rattled and his vision shook with the effort.


Sonny threw open the doors out of breath, waiting for his eyes to adjust. The red and gold carpet stretched out in front of him. Sunlight spilled across the entrance alcove from the doors across the entry nook. Nick was nowhere in sight. Sonny took three or four steps inside toward the high limit lounge, scanning the area all around him. Someone yelled, "he's got a gun!" And then there were screams and panic voices all around him


He was reaching to pull out his badge when Delgado yelled, "look out!" Sonny turned in time to see a blur of motion as his feet left the carpet and the air left his lungs. He hit the ground hard bouncing twice, the gun sliding away before he could stop it.


Rough hands were rolling him onto his stomach he didn't have time to explain. In wrestling, everything is about hip control. Whoever was holding him down had their body weight near the middle of his back. Sonny exploded downward while reaching around his opponent with his right arm. Grabbing and pushing back upward from the balls of his feet to spin around the back of his attacker.


He'd been expecting one of the security guards and fumbled at the sight of Nicholas Starr in his arms. In the split-second fumble, Starr spun a quarter turn into Sonny's grip to place his leg under him and thrust. The kid weighed more than Sonny would've guessed. But the move relied on raw power. If the kid thought he was going to overpower Sonny he was in for a surprise.


 Sonny used Nick's force to stand up adding his strength to the motion. As he rose, he rotated his hips to throw Nick back to the ground. He put everything he had into the reversal but it only worked to separate them. Nick was still standing and now he adapted a ready stance like some kind of kung fu fighter.


Nick's eyes flashed to the left over Sonny's shoulder. He recognized the sound of footsteps running toward them. He dove forward at full speed for a double-leg takedown capitalizing on the boy's distraction. He almost felt bad for the kid. He hoped Nick would be okay after a full force tackle. Light exploded across his vision before everything went dark.


Sonny's ears were ringing, people were touching him. He couldn't remember what he was doing. The world was black and the ground was heaving like he was on a boat. Where was he? Someone was touching his face. He struggled to open his eyes to see the face of a pretty Hispanic woman in front of him. He thought she had been saying his name. "Hi gorgeous, what's your name?'


"Sonny," she said and gave his face a little shake. His vision blurred and the room shifted. He held back the urge to vomit and smiled instead.


"That's funny, my name Sonny too." She stood up and walked away and several men stepped forward to look down at him. He was in a bed. A hotel bed, sunlight was coming through the windows amplifying the gold decor. He could hear voices talking in the background. He concentrated trying to make out what they were saying.


"Completely concussed. He's not going to be doing anything anytime soon. If you aren't going to take him to a hospital, somebody needs to sit him up." The woman's voice. She continued, "has anybody called Holland yet." Holland, where was Holland? Sonny tuned back into her voice, "I need to get back and start looking over at the video footage. I'll need access to more sophisticated equipment to enhance it. Something I can't put my finger on it yet is bothering me. Sit him up but don't let him leave."


Sonny wondered if she was talking about him as he watched her leave. All doubt left him when two of the men pulled him into a sitting position. The room spun again and he vomited a soupy brown liquid that looked like coffee with chunks of Egg McMuffin.


"Jesus Pera, that kid really run your bell. Somebody get me a towel." Sonny stared at the big man in front of them he knew this man. "Darren? What are you doing here?"
