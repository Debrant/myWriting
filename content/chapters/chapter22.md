Nick stared at the duty sergeant staring back at him. Acquainted in the small town kind of way which happened behind the scenes in the French Quarter, he played to the familiarity. Hundreds of thousands of tourists breeze through places like these, their faces become a blur, copies of themselves, at once anonymous and familiar. When a face is seen for more than a few weeks changes to someone you recognize. After a couple of months, the face becomes a person, a local, "one of us."

"Sorry hoss, we ain't got him. How did you say you knew him," the sergeant asked.

"He's my dad's cousin, but I grew up calling him uncle Jack," Nick replied. "He came here in part to visit me and pay his respects. Dad passed a few months back. I planned to take Jack out to the crypt, for closure. Anyway, what he do?"

"He assaulted an NOPD officer, is what. Don Patricio, everybody calls him Officer Pat. Got his head all stitched up, and he's out for two weeks, doctor's orders." The sergeant's ruddy jowls shook as he looked down at his desk and back to Nick several times as he spoke. Nick raised an eyebrow at the last lingering glance, and the sergeant pulled up a composite sketch.

The face in the pencil drawing resembled an over masculine rendition of Nick. He wondered who’d given the details to the artist. Despite a too thick neck and a jawline that bordered on heroic, the resemblance stood out. The artist captured his deep-set eyes and nose with an eerie likeness.

"Does look a bit like you, I am trying to decide whether to call upstairs." It was a clumsy way of asking for an explanation, but the offer would only be extended once as a courtesy for being local.

"Maybe because he’s my cousin Nick. People used to mistake us for brothers as kids. Nick's about fifteen, I think, but I haven’t seen him in a few years. Did he come to town with Jack?"

"I guess so, they ain’t telling us much, the F B I," he drew out the three initials like they tasted bad in his mouth. "Showed up last week, informing us when they got here. Part of an ongoing manhunt that made your uncle a person of interest. They made us do their dirty work with following him, which is when he attacked Pat."

"So the feds took him and want Nick for what?"

The big man rolled his eyes, "above my pay grade. Now, go on and get out o' here before someone decides a cousin is close enough."

Nick turned to leave with a smile, "thanks, sergeant." He turned and walked over to the Supreme Courthouse of Louisiana. At the bottom of the stone staircase, he found a spot to sit with a line of sight on both Royal and Coti. Police cars rolled in and out of the under the courthouse or parked along the streets bordering the two buildings. At 85 degrees, with enough humidity that everything glistened, Nick considered it a pleasant day. A breeze cooled the water in the air, and cloud cover blocked the worst of the heat.

An unmarked Crown Vic of gold-brown pulled up to the driveway, about to turn onto Royal Street with Vincent Taminy behind the wheel. In the French Quarter, only the tourists were strangers to officers Tam and Pat. They were loud and didn't let you forget who wielded the power in any situation. Also, their seniority in the department gave them the first shot at any event security. New Orleans city ordinance for parties, concerts, or other permitted events required the use, off-duty police officers, as "security". Which amounted to either paying the officers the minimum hourly and letting them hang out to drink beer and intimidate party-goers or a hefty payout to get them to leave.

Tam and Pat didn't like to take buy out, they enjoyed mixing with the crowd, and even the occasional beat down, a service they offered for free. Nick stepped off the curb and held out a hand as the car pulled away from the station. Tam slowed, rolling down the window.

"Where ya at?" He hollered out the window.

"I heard about Pat, man too bad, he going to be okay?" He waited for signs of emotion, but as usual, Taminy seemed to live in his own world.

"Yeah, busted open the skin on the top of his bald head when he got knocked out. Head wounds bleed like crazy though, they won't let him on the clock until the stitches come out."

"Well, send him my best and from Angelo," Tam's eyes lifted at Angelo’s name. Rumored to be a semi-retired mafia hit-man, unverified to Nick’s mind, but even the NOPD gave him a wide berth.

"Appreciate it, you two working together now?" He let loose a nervous chuckle and checked his sidearm.

"No, we only hang out for fun, I don't involve myself in his business.. This one's for Pat, though." Nick unslung the messenger bag from over his shoulder and handed the bag through the window. "Get somewhere private before opening, catch you later, Tam."

"I don't want to owe Angelo nothing, Dean, what is this?"

"Lagniappe, don't worry." Taminy nodded, satisfied with the answer, and drove off down Royal Street.

Let Pera work on that.

Now he needed to get to the meetup point with Holland. Nick picked the location beforehand, the garden courtyard of Pat O'Brien's. Almost always empty during the afternoon, the entry on Saint Peter stayed locked until evening, leaving only one way in. Nick made his way to a shady table and waited, a few of his coworkers stopping to say hello as he read a book.

"I can't stay long," Holland warned as he sat at the next table, "I have a tail."

"Alright, how is everything else?"

"Bad enough, Sonny has the local cops in his pocket and we promoted him, so he's lead on this one."

"I won't expect the cops to be supportive for too much longer, I gave them evidence he has been working with Jack."

"Doesn't that put your father at risk?" Holland looked concerned.

"He put himself at risk when he listened to Sonny instead of me, but I don't expect the local badges will push any farther on this. Any idea where they have him?"

"No, Sonny hasn't asked me here for help, somehow he suspects me or got tipped off about Farouk's visit and put two and two together. Either way, he's being far more cautious than normal. I bet he’s hoping I lead you to him."

"I'm going to leave through the employees' entrance and post up at Jackson Square, take your tail through when you leave. With luck, he will lead us to Sonny."

Holland gave Nick a dubious cock-eyed stare as if to say how are you planning to do that? But Nick shrugged his shoulders and ducked away.

Thirty minutes later Holland strolled into view, stopping to buy some French pastries on the edge of the square. He wandered around looking at art and talking to fortune-tellers. Tourism during the summer months consisted almost entirely of other southerners on weekend outings. Everyone else shunned the heat, but today was busier than normal.

As he scanned the crowd from his rooftop perch, Nick spotted Holland's tag-along. His sweat gave him away. Even from this distance, the dark stains soaking through the man’s shirt stood out. Not that southerners didn't perspire, but a proper gentleman wouldn’t let himself drip like that in public. The final confirmation came when the stalker stepped around a tree with practiced grace as Holland changed direction. He committed every detail possible to memory before bounding down the stairs to follow the follower.

Holland led them through the French Quarter in a zig-zagging pattern for several hours until even Nick was in danger of sweating through his shirt. Twice the man doubled back, following some strange personal algorithm. He would deviate from following to hurrying somewhere ahead to see Holland pass from another location, surprising and forcing Nick to take evasive action.

Now, Holland retreated into a Canal Street hotel while “Mr. Shadow” grabbed a sweet tea and some sliders at the Krystal Burger around the corner. Sonny Pera joined him by the time he started the second burger. Nick didn't hesitate. At first sight, he waved for a cab and climbed in.

"Have you ever seen one of those movies where a guy jumps in a cab and says follow that car?" He asked the cabby while pulling out a hundred-dollar bill. "In a little while, a guy in khaki shorts and a blue Hawaiian shirt with white flowers will come out of the Krystal there and get in that black Ford across the street. We are going to follow him, not too close, you good with that?"

The driver fixed Nick with a hard, flat stare from under his prominent brow. Bull-necked with short coarse brown hairs covering him from his scalp to his knuckles, he spoke with the Bronx-like accent of Algiers.

"Better than sitting here doin nothin," he took the hundred. "I'm gonna charge you double if I have to break the law, you good with that?"

"Fair's fair," Nick answered and sat back to wait.

"So, your guy is pretty well off, This is a private community, you've got to have more than money to get in here," Bobby told him as the black sedan paused for the gate to lift before pulling off down the oak lined street. "I'm on a pullover right here, all the tourists stop and gawk when they walk by Audubon Place, you run on up and see if you can see where he goes to the gate if you need to."

"Bobby, you're a gentleman and a scholar," Nick told him as he slid out of the cab and hustled up the street toward the locked, wrought-iron gates in front of the footpath before the guardhouse. The black car continued on the interior road. The long lazy oval with large green garden space in the middle almost resembled a racetrack. Nick strode as fast as he could around the guardhouse not to lose sight of the car as turned around the far end of the drive. The sedan disappeared around the curve at the end, and Nick waited until the guard told him to keep moving. The sedan did not reappear.

Nick considered his options as he returned to the cab. "It’s a pretty long street I lost sight of them at the bend, but he never came back around so he must have parked somewhere near the end."

"Where to now, boss?" Bobby asked as he wheeled the car into the lazy traffic of Carrollton Street. "Cause if you and in a hurry, I got a little sightseeing you might be interested in. Plus the meter ain’t even at twenty yet, and you gave me 100."

"Well okay, sightseeing sounds good, show me what you got," Nick replied and smiled as the cab driver did a U-turn, cutting across the trolley line and heading back toward the city center. Nick considered finding Bobby a stroke of luck. A cab driver for twenty-three years, he loved both the city and driving. He seemed to take Nick's request as a challenge, never coming closer than two cars behind Sonny as he made his way uptown all the while explaining the history of each area they passed.

He pulled the second U-turn in front of the University and a right turn down a narrow alleyway, "we call this Law RD. The interesting thing here, you will note, other than being University property, is the wall on your left is maintained by the property owners on the other side in Audubon place. Here at the beginning, we have a traditional New Orleans style wall; a good 8 feet of cement with stucco and wrought iron spikes on top. A little further on the wall transitions to 7 feet of smooth cinderblock. Now this one looks like the last but with an extra 3 feet of decorative brickwork on top. A lot of the owners worked together to split the cost when they hired builders, but each group did what they felt best. Here we have a hedge wall that isn’t even 6 feet tall, the variability is interesting in the reflection of the people who live here. A history of the development and a statement on the varying degrees to which people put a value on their privacy."

"That is fascinating indeed, Mr. Bobby. I forgot to mention where we are headed now. I stay up on Dauphin and Iberville, which is where I would like to be dropped off, after your informative tour, of course." When they arrived, the ride totaled 39.35, and Bobby cast a searching glance over the seat as he turned the meter off. "Worth every penny, thank you, Bobby," he said, flicking the business card given to him."

"Take care o' yourself, Dean, and be careful, if you planning on going back out there. People with money like that are more often than not, bad news." Nick stood as the cab pulled away, wondering how much of Bobby’s demeanor was genuine and how much was for show. For Nick, making friends came easy, but underneath most people’s public persona, he found most uninteresting. Especially after battling off the malaise which all but consumed him when he first faced the prospect of living again, he no longer “went through the motions” just for the sake of decorum. With so many significant questions to ponder in a universe that sometimes baffled the mind, Nick’s patience for people remained mired in the complaints and pettiness of the day-to-day equaled zero. Boring did not describe Bobby, a better phrase for him might be useful instead.

Nick inscribed a star into the upper right corner of the business card before he put it away after making it upstairs to his flat. Audubon Place kept a twenty-four-hour security team to man the gates and patrol the property, which meant he needed to wait well past nightfall.

He waited until the air turned cool, and the traffic faded to almost nothing. The motorcycle would be too loud for this type of work. So dressed from head to toe in black, Nick climbed into the 1979 Chevy Chevette and made his way uptown.

He parked on the backside of Tulane University on Freret Street, a few blocks from where he and Bobby exited Law Road alleyway. He intended to make his way over one of the lower walls down that alley, but as he drew nearer, he saw an old man smoking a pipe a few dozen paces further on. Before Nick turned down the alley, the old man disappeared with the clanging of a metal gate. He continued past the alley to investigate, coming to a low rough stone wall with a tall wrought-iron fence and a forest of ivy that bordered the northern side of the Audubon place. The wall opened a two-piece swinging gate bordered by square columns of brick.

Nick stopped at the double gate in the middle of the curve where he lost sight of Sonny's car earlier. The old man with the pipe adjuster treated across the lawn of one of the larger houses on the left. The ornate mercury street lamps lit the garden space down the middle but left most of the street in shadow. With one effortless motion, he grabbed the top of the arrow-shaped vertical bars, put a foot in one of the looping iron coils, and vaulted over into the empty street.

He leaned back against the stone pillar that supported the cake you just come over watching and listening for several minutes. No one raised any alarms and nothing moved. He relaxed and looked for Sonny’s black sedan. It seemed as if most of the residents here referred to park along the central island that ran the five-block stretch and parked in the spot closest to him on the right side of the street was Sonny's car.

Nick turned to scan the houses nearest the car and noticed motion along the front veranda of the very first. A long hip-high parapet with ornate columns holding up the stone top surrounded the early century colonial mansion. He crept along the wall, staying as far away from the streetlights as possible. He caught the motion again. A man stood up from leaning in one of the window alcoves, stretching his legs as he did. A second man dressed in a matching black suit and tie joined the first as he watched. They both walked to the edge to sit facing one another.

Nick tried but failed to discern the details of their conversation. He waited as they carried on smoking several cigarettes until the second man returned through the front door. After a few more minutes, the lone figure returned to his little alcove and settled in against the wall.

The way ahead along the border wall of the property looked safe. Nick ducked into a low walk and half crawled toward the back of the mansion. His thighs burned by the time he reached the rear corner of the lot which ended at a guest house. A woman's giggle stopped his forward motion. The soft sound of water splashing reached him, then a gasp and a moan. The splashing intensified as more gasps, moans, and giggles filled the air. Nick risked edging closer for a better view.

Nestled next to the guest house and a boundary wall of trimmed trees, a large rectangular swimming pool sparkled in the moonlight. A broad muscular back glistened as it flexed in a rhythmic motion with a woman's caramel thighs contrasting with the pale skin of the man's lower back. The pool laid lengthwise at the back of the property, the guest house sharing the wall making it impossible for Nick to get any closer. Dressed all in black, he judged himself exposed against the white stucco of the pool house.

Nick retreated into the shadow to wait for the lovemaking to end. Long minutes stretched by with the two splashing and calling out to each other. “Sonny,” she would gasp and he would answer, her name was Aimee. A few of the men on security detail had watched the scene from the balcony of the main house but retreated as the two came to a close. Nick crept back to the corner to listen as they talked in hushed, intimate tones.

“What made you change your mind,” Sonny was asking.

“Watching you recover after Vegas kind of. Well, actually it started when you were out of it, I think that was the first time I realized you were kind underneath all that bravado.”

Sonny laughed, “I guess I can come on a little strong.”

“No, just entitled,” Nick could hear the warmth in her voice. “Anyway, I know it doesn’t make up for it, but I’m not so secretly grateful that you got hurt. These last few months have been…” Her words cut off to the sounds of water.

“Me too,” Sonny said after some time.

“So what are you going to do with Jack Starr? You can’t just keep him locked up in the basement forever.”

“I know, I like Jack. I just need Nick in custody and he fucked up when he attacked that cop. You need to be careful though, you already know way more than you should.”

“Only because you’re little secret boy’s club intentionally keeps rumors circulating to encourage recruitment. Every decent analyst working in contact with your group figured out the basics within their first few weeks.”

The sloshing of water told Nick they were exiting the pool, he had heard enough anyway. He carefully made his way back to the gate on Freret and returned to the car. Tomorrow he would meet Holland for lunch again. He had a lot to puzzle out beforehand.

Holland sat down next to Nick at the very far end of Felix’s Oyster bar, "nice disguise, what did you learn?" Nick had a baseball cap pulled low and big Mardi gras beads around his neck.

His head was still pounding and a slow-burning bubble in his gut had receded even after a dose of extra-strength Tylenol. He looked at Carter and knew what had to come next. "You have to be the one to catch me." He couldn't think of anything else to say.

"What? No, there must be some other way out of this."

"I can't just leave him there. I've already given the NOPD the photos I took of Sonny and Jack. I planted that bug that they were working together with a few of the cops around town. I'm gonna release the pictures to the TV station and file a missing person report, I need to make sure Sonny's face is associated with Jack's disappearance. Meanwhile, I'll try to get one of my friends in the department to give Sonny a fall citing and I want you to figure out a way to get out of this city had north called a tip and inside line whatever you need to you get north capture me bring me in you know all cooperate with you and Farouk. Just feels like any other option is going to get either me or Jack killed, maybe even both of us."

"Once you're in, I'm not sure how we can get you back out."

"One thing at a time, my friend, one thing at a time."
