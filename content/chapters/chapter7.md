The steady thrum of the bus engine gave way to lulls and crescendos. The gentle side to side rocking ceased as the bus began a series of starts and stops that woke Nick from his nap. The college area of downtown Portland was rolling by on the other side of the glass.


The midnight streets of 1984 looked empty and sad. The city of 2040 superimposed over every view. The effect created a surreal landscape of an aging and outdated ghost town. Forlorn dirty parking lots in place of future shopping centers. Everywhere seemed touched by poverty, rundown, forgotten.



The Greyhound depot war a dilapidated single-story building. It was a riot of blues. Faded cream-blue stucco sides with dull Crayola-blue trim. Dark navy guard rails heavy with wear lined each of the 5 terminals inside. The garage occupied half of the block. Low unfinished concrete ceilings made the busses loom and the space feel cramped.



Nick disembarked, unsurprised to find no one waiting for him. Making his way to the under-carriage outside, he scanned the station room behind the glass. The driver handed the big green Airforce duffle bag over and Nick slung it over his shoulder. With a last look over his shoulder, he turned and ambled out of the big bay doors.



He made his way south down the bus mall planning a route to a home that felt conceptual rather than real. The Mall itself ran North-South down 5th and 6th avenues for over a mile. It was part of Portlands "Fairless Square, " which covered the entire downtown area. He stared down the quiet street, rewriting his first impression of the city. The little bus stations glittered like jewels. He could see the future city now, not as a ghost image, but as a design. The city planners had envisioned that future from this simple seed. They had hoped to revitalize the city with bus routes flowing to the heart like a great arterial network.


The bus stops themselves were state of the art for the time. Little two-tiered, pagoda-like roofs covered each oval building. Each mini-station is dedicated to a different area of the city. There were two such stations on the corners of every block each. Nick looked at the bright icons over each list of bus numbers as he walked up the street. A green leaf, then an orange deer.


_That's Tigard then Beaverton if memory serves. This is crazy! Where did I keep all this? Can't find the car keys, but I remember this shit. Incredible. So then I want the yellow rose. Now, let's see how late the busses run._


Spotting the yellow rose ahead, he approached the shelter. Built of a chocolate brown steel and aluminum frame, the shelter was a graceful oval. The curved ends and the roof were all plexiglass. Inside were four thick butcher-block seats, two at either end. Altogether it was reminiscent of a terrarium or a diorama in a museum. A black and white TV hung near the top at one end of the roof. He stepped in to read the display.


SOO-EEE-OOO-EEEEEE-IWP! A keening whistle bellowed in the distance. SOO-EEE-OOO-EEEEEE-IWP! It repeated closer. His heart skipped a beat, he knew that whistle, its rhythm, and its unmistakable volume. He stepped out of the shelter to see a familiar sight in a flash of Deja-vu. A light brown 1966 Studebaker Daytona was swerving up the bus lane.



Jack Starr was half standing in his seat, torso out the window. He had a wild grin to match his wild black curls as he pulled up to the bus stop and jumped out of the car.


"Thought I missed you, come on," he offered as he took the duffle and tossed it into the backseat.


"Dad," Nick managed before his throat seized up. Jack radiated a quiet self-amused charm as he grabbed Nick up into a hug.


"Glad your back son." He said over the embrace. He felt solid in Nick's arms and years of future trauma and a rocky relationship dissolved into tears.


"Hey," Jack soothed, "come on, your home now." He ushered Nick into the passenger seat and ran around to take the wheel. "Rough trip?" He asked as he tore down the avenue making a quick right to get off of the Bus Mall. "Danny can be a real hard-ass, huh?"


"No, not that, he was great. I just had a weird day."


"I thought," he stammered. "I, I didn't think," he paused to gather himself. "I'm just happy to see you, dad, that's all."


"Nicky my boy, I'm happy to see you too." The old Studebaker floated down the street on too loose leaf-spring. Nick recognized the gentle swerve and reassessed his father. The flushed exuberance, the emotional honesty, and his hallmark charm.



_He's drunk!_



Jack drove on, smiling as Nick reminisced over these lost moments now returned. It was tragic from this vantage point. Some of the happiest memories with his father were when the man had been drunk. Everybody loved Jack when he was at the happy drunk stage. As long as he had the money to keep drinking and enough attention from the room, he stayed happy.


The old car pulled into the parking lot of the 16-story student housing building. His parents would both graduate from Portland State in the coming spring. Now the four of them shared a little two-bedroom up on the 10th floor.


"Do you have your key?" Jack asked.


"I don't think so."


"Well take mine, go throw your bag in the door to prop it open. Hurry up and bring it back to me."
"Hmph," Nick let out with a reproachful chuckle. Jack showed no signs of having noticed the momentary disdain.


"Go on, I have to get back to my study group."


Nick took the duffle to the door and threw it down in the entryway to keep it ajar. Returning the key he couldn't help but to throw a little jab.


"It's winter break dad, you aren't studying. Go enjoy your party and say hi to Mary."


Jack's face turned bright red, "You little!"


"What! You little what!" Nick roared back into the window. Jack paled and he wilted a little.



"You're too smart for your own good. How do you know about Mary?"


"It doesn't matter, but you need to come clean. Rip the bandaid off and start your new life."


"I would never leave you guys, it's not like that. Anyway, Mary's visiting her sister for the holidays. It's not for class, I'm working on lining up something for after I graduate. So don't worry so much, I wouldn't leave you guys, it's not like that."


"It's okay dad. It's better even. you and mom aren't happy anyway." Nick turned and walked up the stairs without looking back. He could hear the old engine gas up as he went through the door.



Unit A was the first apartment down in a long hallway of white-washed cinderblock walls. Nick stepped out of the elevator to stare for a minute at the door. When he tried to open it he found it locked and he couldn't suppress a laugh.


He tossed the bag down and unclipped the top before dumping the contents in front of the door. He stared at the pile, looking for the key.



_What the hell am I doing? Trying so hard not to stand out that I'm acting like a teenager?_


He got down on one knee and began sorting the pile. He folded the clothes and stacked them into the duffle. The key was in with the toiletries. He finished putting everything back into the bag and let himself in.


He made his way past the kitchen and stopped at the edge of the living room. The room was so dark that the edges of a homemade door in the false wall glowed like a portal. He walked to the door, it was a three-foot-wide strip of plywood that spanned the eight feet from the floor to the ceiling. He pushed and the door pulsed open as the bottom edge grabbed and released the carpet.


The area inside was brighter, the light from the city spilling in the window that ran the length of the room. With a bed and a nightstand pushed up against the far back wall under the windows the room was long but very narrow. Reaching out his arms he touched the windows and the plywood wall easily.



_How did they justify this? This is awful. Why don't I remember it this way?_


Putting it all out of his mind, he put away his thing and crawled into the little bed. There was no keeping his feet from hanging off of the end.

Nick lay awake squinting into the un-curtained sunlight from the wall of windows. Cold air fell from windows in a river of air. He looked around the room as he set up trying to remember the child who had lived here. The room ran north and south with the windows covering the entire west wall.

The bed, too small sat tucked against the plywood wall that cut him off from the rest of the living room. The north wall oozed cold from whitewashed cinderblock. There was a low nightstand next to the bed and a long makeshift table at the far end of the room next to the window.
A toybox or a chest of some homemade fashion sat between the nightstand and the desk against the wall. Several dogeared paperback books lay scattered across the top of it. Over on the nightstand set a clock and the blue Sony Walkman that brought him a little stab of nostalgia. He swung his legs out of the bed in a single motion and picked up the device. He put the headphones with their bright yellow foam pads over his ears and pressed play.

      Ain't nothin' but a heartache
      Tell me why-iiiiiieeeeeeiiiiiiiii
      Ain't nothin' but a mistake
      Tell me why- iiiiiieeeeeeiiiiiiiii
      I never wanna hear you say
      I want it that way

Nick turned off the tape player smiling. He opened the front drawer of the nightstand to find several dozen more cassette tapes. Most of them mixed tapes with labels like Casey Kasem's top 100 of 1983, or Deep Euro-punk. A scattering of tapes with manufacturers' labels were there as well. Tears for Fears, Dead Kennedys, Pink Floyd, Supertramp, the Alan Parsons Project, The Cure and Prince, and the Revolution. Embarrassment, nostalgia, and excitement all competed for his emotions.
Nick got dressed and left his makeshift bedroom to forage for breakfast. He was warming a pan and was about to start cooking when his younger brother, Saul made his way into the kitchen.
"When did you get back dickhead?"

"Cute, last night. Late. You want some bacon and eggs?"

"Wadar you gonna do 'em?" Was his staccato reply.

" I am going to cook them," he enunciated while making very serious but exaggerated eye contact.

"Yeah, okay."

"Okay? That's all? Not even a yeah thanks Nick or a please?"

"You're not a grown-up, why are you trying to act like one."

"Just sit down and wait for your eggs."

"How's mom been while I was gone?"

"I donno."

"Well, what have you been doing for the last two weeks?"

"Stuff."

Nick couldn't help laughing, it felt good to laugh, he couldn't stop. He was still laughing as he put the bacon down in the pan when his mother came out with a concerned look.

"Are you teasing your brother?"

"No mom, he made a joke. I'm just laughing."

"I did?" Saul looked confused.

"You did, trust me." Nick looked at his mother her long dark hair shiny and black around her smooth unlined face.

_Jesus ya big sap, get a grip already. You can't break down blubbering every time we meet somebody we haven't seen in a couple of decades._

"What's with the stupid grin, mom Nick is acting weird."

He was laughing again and this time for whatever reason they were laughing with him.

"Did dad make it to bed at a reasonable hour?" He finally managed to ask while wiping his eyes.

His mother gave him a sharp biting look lips pinching together, "he picked you up from the bus last night, right?"

"That he did, but he stayed up, and I have no idea what time he went to bed. Late I'm sure."

Her eyes darted from him to Saul and then back to him and she relaxed the look. " Do you want me to take over sweetie?"

"Not at all, would you like me to make some coffee? It should be ready by the time you come back if you want to go and freshen up ?"

The look was back, but this time the corner of her mouth twisted up with a hint of a grin ." Okay" she said slowly, " I'm going. Don't tease your brother."
He made enough for four and began dishing the food onto the mismatched plastic plates. Jane and Jack came out of the back bedroom together. Jack's eyes were puffy and swollen, but he was smiling.
"What's the special occasion?" He asked looking at the food.

"Didn't you get the memo?" Nick looked incredulous, "I'm hurt. I suppose this means you didn't give me a gift?"

Jack scrunched his face up staring from Saul to Jane and then to Nick.

"It's my welcome home party," Nick said chuckling. Jack still looked dubious but was content enough to take a plate of eggs and bacon.
Soon enough everyone was munching their food with contentment.

For the next few days, his old life seemed to almost melt away. Here in this strange but happy superposition of circumstance.
He could see Jack pulling away from the family bit by bit and wondered if his words had struck home. Either way, the man wasn't at home much. Friday afternoon the third day since Nick had been back Jack showed up, radiating energy. He played on the drama of his sudden arrival as he made an exciting announcement.

"I was working with Craig and some of the guys at the lab and we were listening to the radio. Anyway, the DJ says," Jack mimicked a radio voice. " Got 4 tickets here to go see Johnny Dangerously at the Beaverton Cinema this evening. Caller ten wins them starting now and we're throwing in 20 dollars at the concession stand."
Jack stood silent face open wide in expectation. Jane took the bait, "no, you didn't! don't tease. Jack, really?"

"I did! Get your coats, we're going to the movies!"
Nick remembered the movie as being one of his mother's favorites. He did not remember ever going to the opening night of any movie as a child. Saul ran from room to room gathering his shoes and coat. He asked rapid-fire questions about What he could get from the concession stand. Even Jane seemed to have forgotten that Jack had spent the last 72 hours doing who knows what.
Everyone had a good time, even Nick. It was good to see his mother and his brother and even his father all laughing and enjoying themselves. But Nick couldn't shake the feeling that Jack was hiding something. Hf watched him out of the corner of his eye all night.

The next day Jack was gone again in the morning. Nick woke to the sound of Saturday morning cartoons blaring in the other room. Upon arriving in the living room Saul proudly informed him that Christmas was three days away.
He made Saul breakfast while Gargamel chased the Smurfs in the background. When he was sure that things were good enough he scribbled a quick note to his mother.

    Mom,
    I'm going to swing by school to see if I can get some things out of my locker, and then I'm going down to the Market Plaza.
    I'm going to ask Ali if I can have my job back. I would like to start working on the weekends again. I fed Saul should be back by 2 PM.
    Love,
    Nick
