<h1>Chapter 1</h1>

<br><br>
<p>Carter Holland hung up his church clothes in the hallway closet of his10th floor one-bedroom apartment before gliding across the room to look out over Baltimore Harbor. The sliding glass door opened onto the modest balcony. The harbor was abuzz with tourists enjoying the mild late-season weather. It was beautiful here, the gray sky shining over the dark waters, making the new shops and buildings of the Harbor development project look pristine and solid. But for every dollar that Baltimore invested in improving downtown, it seemed to take two from historic black inner-city neighborhoods.
The trend made him worry about his mother, Chidi. Now 72, Chidi was living alone in their family home. Old West Baltimore was showing signs of crisis. The streets were falling into disarray as house after the house fell into disrepair. Abandoned and condemned as crack cocaine worked its way deeper and deeper into the inner-city, and no one seemed to care as long as it stayed out of the business areas in the white neighborhoods.</p>
<p>They had arranged the apartment here by the waterfront as part of his new position, overseeing cross-agency collaboration from within the CIA. Two years! Time had flown, and he still wasn&rsquo;t used to his newfound freedoms and status. The chance to live here in the city was one perk though, and spending time with his family was something that he thought he&rsquo;d lost forever when he signed on to the CIA after the Vietnam War.</p>
<p>What a fool he&rsquo;d been, thinking that he could save the world. &ldquo;Make a difference for America&rdquo;. The older he got, the less it seemed like America cared. Two years, and he was still trying to win back his mother&rsquo;s trust. Not that he could blame her. His recruitment into covert ops came with a cover story that he was missing in action and presumed dead at the end of the Vietnam war. Until one day nearly 12 years later a well-dressed man in his late 30s turned up for Thanksgiving dinner claiming to be her long-lost son.</p>
<p>Chidi was no pushover, though. She had grilled him, squeezing every detail that he could reveal to her. To say his mother was less than happy with his choices would have been an understatement. Growing up, she&rsquo;d been his hero, beautiful, intelligent, and outspoken about injustice. Outspoken enough to have been singled out as a prime agitator during the 1929 women&rsquo;s war in Nigeria. She talked little about why or when she left Africa exactly, but everyone in the family knew she and their father met here in Baltimore. His father, a refugee from the Herero genocide, found in Chidi a kindred spirit, and the two were inseparable until the day he died.</p>
<p>Carter could barely remember his father now, just snippets of memory, but he remembered being proud of how his parents seem to be at the center of their community, holding everyone together. He understood that was part of the reason she would never leave their home in Old West Baltimore. The look of hurt and betrayal she&rsquo;d leveled on him when he suggested it had been more than enough to silence the issue. &ldquo;You who abandoned me, who abandoned your family to travel the world on behalf of the white man, you dare to ask me to intern abandon our home?&rdquo; It was all there in a single expression, without ever saying a word. In fact, she barely spoke to him for more than a month after that.</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t erase that pain for either of them, but they had settled into a steady if amiable cadence of getting to know one another again. On weeks where he was in the city, he would show up early at momma&rsquo;s house on Sunday mornings for breakfast. His only living brother and closest sister would join him to eat and help clean up before the family would pile into dad&rsquo;s old 1954 Crestline and head to church. After church, they would all return to mom&rsquo;s house and chip in with chores or maintenance, all while talking and laughing. Everyone in the neighborhood, those who remained, was welcome for Sunday lunches.</p>
<p>At first, he had done it thinking it was for his mother but soon realized that every week he reclaimed a piece of his soul that he dropped on some foreign beach or back alley like loose change.</p>
<p>Ring, ringâ€¦ Ring, ring!</p>
<p>The jarring metallic sound of the phone on the wall snapped him out of his melancholy reflections and back into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holland here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a message from the desk of Randall Parra Senior. Begin message; agent becomes Pathfinder, recent evidence requires immediate redeployment. I&rsquo;m sending my grandson with you, guide him and teach him what you can so that he may make us proud. End of message. A plane will meet you at 1700 hrs. on runway two at Warfield airbase.&rdquo; The line clicked off.</p>
<p>Holland stood straight in the middle of the room, clasping his hands behind his head to take a deep breath while stretching hard and clamping his eyes closed. He opened his eyes and dropped his hands and became motion with no wasted effort. The sliding glass door shut and locked. Perishables from the refrigerator in a plastic bag, tied and ready by the door to be thrown away on the way out. Six envelopes each sealed with a date on top, lying on the bed next to a suitcase now packed with two black suits identical to the one he was wearing. With a quick zip, he closed the case and tucked the envelopes into his breast pocket, making sure his service piece was secure against his chest and the bifold containing his ID was tight on his hip.</p>
<p>His brother&rsquo;s house wasn&rsquo;t exactly on the way, but he still had time, and it was necessary. Carter knocked hard three times and a moment later his brother answered, still wearing his church slacks but dressed down to a T-shirt on top. He looked surprised but not unhappy, the smile fading as he took in his little brother&rsquo;s demeanor and dress.</p>
<p>His brother rested his broad, warm hand on Carter&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;How long will it be this time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure yet, they have not briefed yet me, but it sounds serious.&rdquo; He pulled out the six envelopes in the spare key. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Carter began haltingly. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t probably had no idea what you were signing up for when you said you would help, but I appreciate it. This is a key to the apartment downtown, use it, it&rsquo;s paid for by the agency and somebody ought to enjoy it, it&rsquo;s pretty nice. There is a letter in each one of those and some cash to help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carter, these are all post-stamped already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a habit that goes with the trade. There is one every month from now to June. Hopefully, whatever this is will give me a chance to either write more or be back before they run out. Take care of mama.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy, what you think I&rsquo;ve been doing all these years while you weren&rsquo;t here.&rdquo; There was a hard edge to that comment, but then his brother softened. &ldquo;Take care yourself Carter and make it back safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; was all he could get out. In moments like these, he&rsquo;d learned to detach himself from his emotional responses while he carried out what needed to be done. Little over half an hour later it was flashing his badge to the young airmen at the liftgate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One moment, sir, we have instructions to store your vehicle and escort you to runway two. If you don&rsquo;t mind pulling your vehicle directly behind the guardhouse someone will be here shortly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holland left the keys in the ignition and pulled his travel back out from the passenger seat. He could see a Jeep speeding toward them as he straightened. The MP at the wheel gave him a crisp salute as he pulled the Jeep to a stop, &ldquo;Sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holland saluted back and climbed into the Jeep next to him. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get to it then, son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little Jeep took off, bouncing and jostling as the driver sped his way across the base. &ldquo;Your bird is on approach now, sir. I was told to make sure you were there to greet it when it lands, sorry about the ride.&rdquo; Holland nodded and held onto the bottom of the seat with one hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There she is now!&rdquo; The young airmen said excitedly, pointing farther off Holland&rsquo;s right. &ldquo;You must have rich friends,&rdquo; he said as he admired the aircraft.</p>
<p>Holland was actually a little surprised to see the Gulfstream business jet speeding down the runway. Someone was using personal resources to get things done faster. That, combined with the message directly from Randall Pera Sr., had him a little on edge. The Jeep came to a stop 30 seconds before the plane, which decelerated gently not one hundred feet away from them.</p>
<p>A semicircular section behind the cockpit opened up and rolled down to reveal the entry stairs. Holland picked up his travel bag, saluted the driver, and boarded the plane. The interior of the plane looked like someone&rsquo;s idea of a furniture rental showroom. Plush leather lounge chairs set around a dark wood conference table and behind that a large sofa. The pilot stepped out of the cockpit, extending a hand. &ldquo;Gregory Humboldt, you must be Carter Holland. I rarely get to fly these things around, but don&rsquo;t worry, she handles like a dream it&rsquo;ll be smooth sailing all the way to California.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;California?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The flight plan says we are landing at Montague Airport in Northern California, just west of Yreka. They set the projector up over there and that remote should cue the videotape they&rsquo;ve left you. Everything you need to know is on the tape or in the packet next to the seat. Now sit back and enjoy the ride.&rdquo; Humboldt returned to the cockpit, closing the door behind him, and the sound of the engines spooling up shortly after convinced Holland to take his seat.</p>
<p>The deep, high-backed chair was more comfortable than it looked, and Holland settled into it to pick up the remote. He started watching the briefing video in silence while reading through the notes when a voice from behind him called out, &ldquo;can you turn that down! I&rsquo;m trying to sleep back here, my head is pounding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carter swiveled his chair in place to examine the man with a pillow over his head lying on the couch. &ldquo;Jesus Christ, Sonny, are you wearing pajamas?&rdquo; Sonny Pera was supposed to be Holland&rsquo;s protÃ©gÃ©, but he hadn&rsquo;t seen the man in several months.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good to see you too, Holland. And yes, these are my pajamas. I was in the city last night at a fundraiser that turned into a private party and wasn&rsquo;t expecting to do anything today except sleep when I went to bed just after sunrise. Do you know what this is yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I was just starting the briefing video. You really look like hell, though. I can fill you in later if you want to catch up or I can wait to start it until we brew a pot of coffee for you, your call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sonny stared at his wristwatch for a long second before replying. &ldquo;I heard the pilot say we&rsquo;re going to California that&rsquo;s like six hours so we should get there late evening local time? I&rsquo;ll stay up now and save the jet lag tomorrow. Let me get some coffee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holland rewound the video as Sonny readied himself and pressed play when he sat down with a steaming cup of coffee.</p>
<p>A hard-eyed man in his 50s with a graying, receding hairline sat behind the desk looking into the camera, reading notes from a sheet of paper in front of him. &ldquo;Approximately 90 minutes before you boarded this plane 16 research and observation centers around the world detected simultaneous high-frequency energy bursts. Each at a known observation point. The signals repeated three times in each location with exactly the same timestamp before stopping. Then 16 minutes and 40 seconds later one high elevation radio telescope and three research centers all in the northern California wilderness detected the same signal but it tenfold intensity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man put the paper face down in front of him and steepled his fingers. &ldquo;Each one of these known sites has been increasingly active over the last 115 days and we believe the new site correlates to a Class-I relic being activated somewhere within a 60-mile radius of the I5 crossing between working in California. Agent Holland, you will act and function under your current role as liaison to the FBI and it is imperative that you maintain FBI cover the entire time you are on assignment. Agent Pera, this will be your first fully off-the-book operation. Follow Holland&rsquo;s lead at every step. You will understand better than anyone how important this is to the family. Consider your budget unlimited and any local resource you need, redirected. Use priority lines only. We have half of Analytics working backup for you on this. Anything you need, call it in. A science team will meet you on the ground with the equipment you will need to track down the source of the emissions. This is our first chance since world war two to get our hand on the relic, don&rsquo;t fuck it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The video ended there. Holland began thumbing through the paperwork, handing each sheet over to Sonny as he finished. The locations of all recorded relic sightings in this century. A list that matched each sighting to coincidental events and historical data. The setup and deployment of observation points. Devices used to measure and detect. The last page contained an elegant draft drawing, complete with dimensioning and shading of the suspected Class-I relic.</p>
<p>Holland stared at the drawing, trying to wrap his head around all of it. He handed the last sheet to Sonny, who looked and commented, &ldquo;oh, it&rsquo;s a charcoal briquette, now it all makes sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hilarious, but Sonny, do you know who the man on that tape was? What did he mean you understand better than anyone?&rdquo;
&ldquo;That is my old man, Randal Jr. He&rsquo;s a real charmer, doesn&rsquo;t even shit without granddad&rsquo;s permission.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Okay, so fill me in. What does this have to do with your family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh wow, yeah, okay, man. So Randall Sr. Served in World War one and two. As a kid in the first war, he got ambushed by a lone German officer in the woods. This man knew Randall&rsquo;s name and some of our family history. He tortured and interrogated Randall for two days before leaving him to die in the well of an abandoned farmhouse. Randall came back from the war, after a timely rescue, obsessed with a family legend. That German had asked questions about our family that connected to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Connected to what? The family legend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. My grandfather was evidently very close to his grandfather, who taught Randall the legend like some secret rite of passage. This relic or one very like it, evidently used to belong to our family, and the German was asking all kinds of questions about it. He knew things about my grandfather that should&rsquo;ve been impossible. From that moment on he&rsquo;s made it his personal mission to recover this relic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holland reached over and retrieved the draft drawing, looking it over one more time. &ldquo;There are some very specific notes here, like shape not a visually evident. Someone had to have physically examined this thing. How is that possible if he&rsquo;s been looking for the entire time? And what is it and what does it do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah yeah, right? There&rsquo;s so much to unpack here. Honestly, I never really paid much attention to any of it. I always thought my granddad was a little off, intense, driven, and successful, but off. He ran into the same German officer again during World War II. Randall was in his mid-40s and a Lieutenant Commander, I think. Anyway, that same guy just shows up and surrenders himself and he has the relic on him. I never learned any of the details of that story except that he somehow vanished without a trace, taking the relic with him, never to be seen again. But Randall Senior had the chance to hold it and study it for a time. My dad says he never really forgiven himself for following the chain of command and turning the relic over to the military. He blamed himself for losing it, so to him, this has been the focus of his entire life.&rdquo; Sonny fell silent for a moment, shaking his head. &ldquo;It all sounds so crazy when you say it out loud, but here we are flying off to chase it down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve met your grandfather on several occasions, and don&rsquo;t think I could describe him as anything other than a very serious man. I&rsquo;m not inclined to write off anything he believes in with that much conviction. You didn&rsquo;t answer my question about what&rsquo;s this thing supposed to do though. And there&rsquo;s disturbingly little information in here,&rdquo; he said, tapping the packet of documents on the table. &ldquo;To indicate why it would be so important.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Shit, man, I don&rsquo;t fucking know! It&rsquo;s a goddamn magic rock, it&rsquo;s supposed to give the user access to wealth and power knowledge that no one else can possess as far as I understand it. I&rsquo;m gonna take a nap, wake me up when we get there. This is all too much to process on a hangover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sonny was snoring within minutes and Holland busied himself reading and rereading the packet of documents until the plane landed.
On the ground, true to the briefing promise, a team waited for them on the tarmac. They led him to a rented hanger that would serve as a makeshift headquarters. Inside, several rollout chalkboards and corkboards crowded around two long folding tables. Out in the center of the hangar, a single propeller plane with room for maybe four people, including the pilot, was being fueled and inspected by a mechanic.</p>
<p>Within minutes, Holland and the team filled the corkboard with paper images. On the chalkboard, a sciencey type busily transcribed all recorded events along with approximate locations and timestamps. Within 30 minutes of landing, the team gathered around him at the board and he prompted them to begin. &ldquo;All right, nice work. Show me what you have so far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man Holland had taken to be an assistant professor or something similar step forward to the time-stamped chalkboard. Turning a piece of chalk sideways, he drew a broad flat line under the first 16 entries. &ldquo;Everything from here down is local. We analyzed the signals while waiting for you to show up. Each transmission is 10 seconds with a thousand seconds in between.&rdquo; He looked at his watch. &ldquo;This last transmission came through while we were setting up and the next will arrive in approximately 5 1/2 minutes.&rdquo; He moved over to a map tacked to the corkboard and removed a red marker. Definitely an aspiring professor. &ldquo;We are here,&rdquo; he said, making a red dot on the map. &ldquo;This cone represents the approximate direction of the transmission source. Every subsequent transmission is getting weaker and magnitude, which means we will infer the approximate range at which we will need to search when the signal cuts out below our measurement ability.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sonny interrupted, &ldquo;how will losing the signal help you know where it&rsquo;s at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the perfect opportunity to gain the respect of the technical members on the team and remind Sonny that he had a lot to learn. &ldquo;Sometimes I wonder how you made it through the Academy agent Pera. We can measure transmitted signals in dB. If the frequency and strength are both known, the range is easy to calculate. There are a lot of factors that affect signal loss, but if we can plot the range result vs signal strength until we have a confident trend-line then we can infer both the approximate current distance and when the signal should cut out. Not only that, but we should know how long we will have to find it once the signal cuts out and be able to determine the altitude we will need to search from.&rdquo; He turned to the man near the map. &ldquo;Does that about sum it up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes were open a little wider than they had been before, in a grin to touch the corners of his mouth. &ldquo;It does, sir. Would you like to see the initial projections?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, let&rsquo;s not waste any time. I pleased to have good help with this, what&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir, I&rsquo;m Mark Spicer I am actually a professor at UC Berkeley, but I have clearance and frequently work with the agencies in the area.&rdquo; He moved just north of the California border and drew a ten-inch-long arc and then another slightly shorter one several inches below that connecting the sides to create an area that he circled. &ldquo;This is about as good as we can do right now, but the signal should be somewhere in this vicinity. That&rsquo;s about 25 miles north at a confidence of approximately plus or minus five miles. We&rsquo;re working on getting better triangulation, but right now the best I can offer is this 20 mile wide by a 5-mile thick strip of Jackson County Oregon. We anticipate losing the signal at about 3 AM this coming morning. But that&rsquo;s the end of the good news. The equipment that we have on the plane should be able to pick up a signal from as far as a thousand feet away but only within a 15Â° arc. Finding the exact location by searching a 224,000 square-foot area for 10 seconds every 16 minutes in an area of approximately 2,780,000,000 mi.Â² could take weeks. It will be like looking for a needle in a haystack, the only bright side is that the parabolic antenna we have should pick up the signal for 22 days if we boost it with a portable generator that about 16 days in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right folks, you heard Professor Spicer, our task is going to be one hell of a lot harder if we don&rsquo;t get better triangulation data. Any resource you need from law enforcement to local universities ask. Anything we can do to narrow down our search is going to get us all home that much sooner and I don&rsquo;t like the sound of spending Christmas in Yreka.&rdquo; He got a few chuckles from the group with that and an appreciative nod from Mark Spicer. He continued, &ldquo;agent Pera and I are going to arrange accommodations. I&rsquo;m leaving my pager number here at the top of the blackboard and agent Pera&rsquo;s directly below that. I expect everyone here that has anything to add to the triangulation effort to be working directly until 3 AM, we&rsquo;ll reconvene here back at 10 AM in consideration of the late night. Let&rsquo;s get to work, call if you need anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had a good feeling about this crew. With any luck, he would be back in Baltimore in no time at all.</p>
