<h1>Chapter 21</h1>

<br><br>
<p>She caught his eye again while serving drinks to the young men across the balcony. Her lips twisted into a grin as their eyes met. Something in the pit of Jack’s stomach twisted with delight. He knew she wanted to know more about him, a lot more. He looked around. The make-shift music hall was bereft of traditional adornment, no posters, no art, just blue-grey concrete walls.</p>
<p>Something about the underground venue had a rough and tumble vibe that added to Jack’s excitement. The ground floor was one big open space, a converted warehouse with a bar on one side of the fifty-foot room. On the far side, opposite the doors, constructed of 2x4 and plywood, was the stage. Upstairs a mezzanine overshadowed half the floor below. Catwalks hugged each wall, lights aimed at the stage bolted along the wooden rails.</p>
<p>“Hey, can I get you another,” she was leaning over with her hands on the table to speak directly into his ear. Her hair brushed his cheek and the smell of hairspray and cigarette smoke carried him away for a moment.</p>
<p>“Yes, thanks,” he paused, holding out his hand.</p>
<p>“Rochelle, where are you from sweetie?”</p>
<p>“I’m Jack, and,” he tried to think of the best way to impress her. She didn’t seem like the big city type, “I’m from Bangor, Maine, ever heard of it?”</p>
<p>“Sure, who doesn’t love a little Stephen King?” She ran her hand down his forearm as she leaned further, “We should get a drink after the show.” Jack let his eyes close as she walked away. He would need an excuse to stay, but not one that Nick would want to stay for.</p>
<p>Nick, still couldn’t quite believe the things he had read in Sonny’s letter. Things had played out just as Sonny had detailed, but he made Nick sound like some kind of mastermind or special forces badass. It made little sense, Nick was awkward, not athletic, and book smart not street smart.</p>
<p>Still, Jack had gone to all the places he had been told to visit and Nick had sent a letter on the table as Jack was eating beignets and drinking a coke. He knew it meant Nick was watching him, which was a little unsettling, as Jack had thought the entire affair up until that moment proved that Sonny was a nut-job.</p>
<p>It had been late morning on his third morning after meeting with Sonny. Jack, following the instructions, came to the Cafe’ du Monde every day before “sight-seeing”. Beignets, it turned out were like big lumpy donut holes. Sweet, with a slight crunch under the powdered sugar, but moist and hot inside. The coffee he had learned on the first day was weird. Here in the south, the locals had been using a spice called “chicory” in their coffee since supply shortages during the civil war had forced them to stretch out what little they had by mixing more and more of the spice into the blend.</p>
<p>The result was both nutty and more bitter. The server had offered him hot drinking chocolate when he had seen Jack’s grimace, but he felt like a kid drinking cocoa, so it had been coca-cola instead. By the third day, the servers all knew they delivered him and his pastries and a coke upon arrival.</p>
<p>“Mr. Jack, you didn’t tell me you had family down here,” Henry said as he slid the warm basket across the table. When Jack didn’t respond, the aging cafe worker continued in his slow, rounded southern English.</p>
<p>“Your cousin came by not ten minutes ago. He said to tell you sorry he couldn’t stay and wait for you, but he asked me to give you this.” He handed Jack an envelope. His name scrawled in bold swooping letters across the front. “Jack Starr see, “he offed the letter again, and this time Jack took it. “I’m gonna leave you to it then, holla if you need anything, Mr. Jack.”</p>
<p>“Thanks, Henry, hey before you go, what did he look like? I haven’t seen my cousin in a long time. I don’t want him sneaking up on me, he’s always been a bit of a prankster.”</p>
<p>“What, Dean? I guess I could see that he do like to share a laugh. If you worried on recognizin ‘im, I wouldn’t. You can see the family resemblance from way off. He big, like you, a bit more fit, beggin your pardon Mr. Jack, but then again he’s a little younger than you too. Only thing, you might to expect is all that hair, I keeps tellin him he need a haircut, but he always jus laugh at me.”</p>
<p>The letter had been a shock;</p>
<p>Dad,
Sonny Pera is dangerous, you need to be careful. Do not tell him about this letter until after we meet. He wants you to lead him to me, I’m hoping that you won’t play along. If you will meet without him, go to the Ernst Cafe on Thursday after 9 (late, not early). Find Mike behind the main bar and tell him your name and ask for your tickets. There is a rock show in an empty warehouse around the corner on S. Peter starting at 10. Get in and go upstairs, I will find you if you are alone.
I love you dad.
Nick</p>
<p>Now he waited, he almost hoped that Nick wouldn’t show. This town was growing on him. He hadn’t told Sonny everything, but that Nick had made contact. Sonny hadn’t pushed him about it, and in fact, he gave Jack the same advice Nick had. “Nick is dangerous, please be careful, Jack.”</p>
<p>He snapped back to the moment as Rochelle sauntered back over. He felt giddy, some part of his brain noting her lack of serving tray. “I’m taking a break, follow me,” she said and kept walking toward a door at the end of the walkway over the stage.</p>
<p>He couldn’t believe his luck. A few strides down the walkway after her when he thought of Nick and paused, but then Rochelle was through the door and waving him to follow with a devilish grin.</p>
<p>It was dark on the other side of the door. The stage below cast shadowy light up through the metal catwalk. Rochelle was already on the far side opening another door, this one with an emergency exit light highlighting her figure. He hurried after her, the feeling in his stomach pushing upward into his chest.</p>
<p>“Where are we going,” Jack asked with a giggle as he followed through the door. When the door shut behind him, it was like being transported to a new reality. White-washed brick lined the fire corridor, muting the sounds of the rock music to a dull pulsing thrum. Yellow incandescent bulbs protruded from the walls, reflecting bright circles, but leaving the spaces in between a war zone of shadows.</p>
<p>Rochelle called out from down the hall, “You should come back when you’re done. I get off around one,” she opened another door and stepped through, leaving him alone in the hall. He hurried after, still grinning as he tried to open the door to follow.</p>
<p>“Hey, it’s locked, I can’t get in,” he knocked harder, doubt blossomed, turning to sour embarrassment. Jack stepped back from the door to examine the hall with a new purpose. The hall ended at one end with foot-tall letters stenciled in black over an arrow, EXIT.</p>
<p>With a quick glance to make sure no one had witnessed the episode, he shoved the shame down and made toward the way out. The staircase opened out onto an empty street of cobblestone. Something about the worn-out brick buildings and the layer of grime told him it wasn’t safe. Jack paused, still holding the door as he mapped the way back to the front of the club. Satisfied the street was empty, he cut left toward the closer of the two cross streets where Ernst was just visible on the corner.</p>
<p>Three or four strides later a figure appeared in front of him, Jack stopped dead in his tracks. There was a dangerous grace in the newcomer’s motion and for a moment Jack considered running. “Back off, buddy,” he shouted, throwing as much bass in as he could. A warm, deep rolling chuckle greeted him in return.</p>
<p>“Lighten up Jack,” the mirth filled baritone familiar.</p>
<p>“Nick?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, come on,” he gestured Jack toward a two-door yellow hatchback. “Agent Pera will be here any minute, we’ve gotta go.” He opened the passenger door first before taking the driver’s seat. “What you doing? Get in the car.”</p>
<p>“No Nick,” Jack dug in his heels, irritation bubbling to the surface. “Did you set me up back there?”</p>
<p>“We don’t have time for this Jack, get in the car.” Headlights pull around the corner, Nick started the engine, “get in the car!” He moved to the hood, shaking his head.</p>
<p>Another set of lights joined the first, which was halfway up the block now. “Just stop this, what are you even doing here, son?”</p>
<p>Nick stared through the window at him, the headlights making his features clear as he gave a tiny disappointed shake. The yellow car lurched backward, turning to jump the curb as the first of the other vehicles came screeching sideways into the now vacant spot.</p>
<p>A heavy thud sounded as the passenger door slammed shut when the car jumped forward to speed up the sidewalk. The other car skid sideways, turning to follow Nick. Two men in pale T-shirts under combat vests passed Jack on foot. One was slowing to sight a rifle at the retreating car. Anger exploded like a slap in Jack’s face and he moved without thinking.</p>
<p>He might not have been in great shape for a man in his thirties, but he rocketed across the gap at top speed, crashing into the rifleman like a 230-pound silverback gorilla. The shooter bounced off of the stone facade of the warehouse behind him, falling to the ground unconscious. Jack stared as blood welled, spreading out on the sidewalk. A buzzing ring drowned out the world around him until something struck him on the cheek with a wet smack.</p>
<p>Another blow followed, a dull throb spreading out across the side of his face. When the third punch landed, his skull reverberated with bass-like resonance. He threw his arms up to fend off the attacker, pulling his eyes away from the bleeding man. The scene unfolded in slow motion, blood, warm on his cheek, the yellow car’s squealing tires as it rounded the far-away corner.</p>
<p>His attacker was still swinging, but Jack’s longer arms were forcing the blows to fall short. Punches rained around his shoulder for a moment longer, Jack tried to grab an arm with his free hand as they slowed. Something hard hit the back of his calf as he took a fistful of the man’s vest. Their combined weight was tipping over the other knee. It gave way. The cobblestones rushed up to meet his back, and the air left his body.</p>
<p>Jack stared at the grey brick-like stones under his cheek, wondering when he had rolled over. “You&rsquo;re fucked now, shit bird!” Someone yelled behind him as a click-click-click sound accompanied a pinching sensation around his wrists. “This is Taminy, I need an ambulance on the 600 block of Fulton,” the radio crackled back from farther away. “Pat, Pat, come on, hang in there, chief.”</p>
<p>Jack’s face was throbbing. He wiggled to his side, trying to see what was happening. His feet were still lying on the sidewalk, but he had fallen into the street. The man Jack had knocked out was moving now, his partner helping him sit up. Jack finished rolling, bringing his knees up off the curb to get his feet underneath of him. He sat up and then pushing one leg out in front of him, rose to his feet with shaky legs.</p>
<p>A quick glance over his shoulder confirmed that the man who&rsquo;d cuffed him was still busy with his partner or friend. He was at a loss, nothing made sense, he only knew he could not stay here. On pure instinct, Jack ran in the opposite direction, back toward the café. The uneven cobblestone’s forced a stumble as he ran with hands cuffed behind him.</p>
<p>He was halfway there, behind him the man swore, &ldquo;son of a bitch!&rdquo; Only a little over 50 feet left to go, he was planning to duck in through the back doors and make his way to the bathroom. With any luck, he could get his hands in front of him and get cleaned up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; a familiar voice said as he rounded the corner. Sonny Pera was smiling as he moved toward him, &ldquo;what happened to you man?&rdquo; Intense relief broke through the panic, Jack held back tears. Sonny&rsquo;s fist caught him in the middle of the stomach before he could answer. The punch lifted Jack off his heels for a split second before he crumpled to the ground, gasping for air. Vomit spewed from Jack and felt like it was trying to push itself out of his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Jack, you had that coming,&rdquo; he said while rubbing his upper back until Jack caught his breath. Still smiling, he picked Jack up like a rag-doll pushed him against the wall. &ldquo;You know what the fucked up thing is? I like hanging out with you Jack, I was going to bend the rules to bring you on.&rdquo; He pulled his hand back and then forward across Jack&rsquo;s face, Jack’s knees gave way to a sound like thunder, but Sonny didn&rsquo;t let him fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&rsquo;d you have to pick tonight to grow a pair of balls? You don’t seem capable of making up your mind,&rdquo; Sonny was dragging him back around the corner. The left side of Jack&rsquo;s face was on fire, and the right side still ached from earlier. His knees felt as if they had extra joints as Sonny pushed him up the cobblestone lane.</p>
<p>“Night, night Jack.&quot; His nose made a sound like dry kindling snapping, white light exploded across his vision. Everything else faded away.</p>
<p>Jack’s labored breathing woke him. He couldn&rsquo;t breathe through the painfully tight mass of flesh of his nose. Something held his eyes closed. He reached up to feel what it was. His arm came to a stop with a sudden jolt of pain in his wrist. Instinctively he caressed the wrist with the other hand and found the hard profile of a handcuff encircling it.</p>
<p>Jack wiggled to a seated lean, scraping a sticky putty-like goo from his eyes. As he blinked away the blur, he found bits of red coagulated lumps in the brown powder, blood. The rusting metal frame iron cot held the other end of his shackle. The lumpy, stained green mattress created a stark contrast with the warm hues and hardwoods of the spacious colonial room.</p>
<p>A true southern plantation-style decor, high ceilings with lazy turning fans, the far wall opened into a grand veranda overlooking a rolling green garden. As he scanned the room, Jack noticed a man sat with his back to the room overlooking the garden. Smoke curls showed white in the sunbeams as they made their slow dance to the ceiling. &ldquo;You have to hand it to the old South Jack, they knew how to live in comfort. Ice clinked in Sonny&rsquo;s glass as he finished it with a sharp tug.</p>
<p>Something about him had changed. Sonny looked calm, almost happy as he strode to the cot. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; Jack&rsquo;s mind was a jumble of images from the night before, &ldquo;you hit me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, more than once. You&rsquo;re lucky I did, that skull you cracked, was NOPD. They didn&rsquo;t want to let you leave with me. I had to promise not to go easy on you,&rdquo; he commented, taking off his shirt and folding in on a nearby chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were cops? Oh God, is he okay? He was going to shoot Nick. I didn&rsquo;t mean to. Hey, what are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sonny was spreading out a roll of plastic on the floor. &ldquo;Keeping my promises, Jack,&rdquo; he said as if that explained everything.</p>
<p>When he finished, a high-backed armchair sat in the middle of the plastic square. A rolling table next to it, on top, a bowl of ice, a pile of hand towels, and a Polaroid Instamatic camera. &ldquo;Are you ready to have some fun,&rdquo; Sonny hollered with an energetic clap of his hands.</p>
<p>“Sonny, Sonny, come on, this isn&rsquo;t funny,&rdquo; Jack whined as Sonny manhandled him into the armchair. He produced a second set of police cuffs to lock both arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re wrong, it&rsquo;s hilarious. Or ironic, maybe both. Not because you finally lost that smug way of talking down to everyone around you. Not because you&rsquo;re just a poor substitute for who I want sitting where you are instead. No, this is funny because I should have seen it coming. Here I thought we were building something, Jack. But it&rsquo;s true what they say about you common folk. Even when you have everything you might need to make more of yourselves, you&rsquo;d rather roll around in the shit with everyone else at the pigs you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sonny picked up a wad of hand towels, pride Jack&rsquo;s mouth open to shove them in making him gag &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of listening to you talk. Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ve already done enough damage to your face. I need you to be recognizable when I post your pictures around town. Either your boy will come looking for you or he won&rsquo;t, either way, is fine with me, Jack. I will find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t understand how he never noticed it before. Looking at Sonny now, his desperation was obvious. Had it always been there, just below the surface? Had he convinced himself that this man wasn&rsquo;t a cold-blooded killer? A slow-rolling chuckle bubbled up from Sonny&rsquo;s chest as he cocked his arm back and struck Jack full in the ear.</p>
<p>Pain exploded through Jack&rsquo;s mind&rsquo;s vision went all-white for a second. As the world came back into focus a keening ring overwhelmed his senses. He could see Sonny&rsquo;s mouth moving, but he couldn&rsquo;t hear anything over the high-pitched squeal in his ear. The next shot landed to the side of his stomach, that&rsquo;s when Jack began to wonder if he was going to die.</p>
<p>This is it, he’s going to kill me. I can&rsquo;t give up. Did he say he would do worse to Nick? I can&rsquo;t give up. I don’t want to cry. I can&rsquo;t give up.</p>
<p>“Come on stay with me Jack, no passing out, I’m not sweating yet.” Jack stared at his feet watching the drops of blood drip, splattering intricate designs on the plastic. Sonny unlocked Jack’s right hand and pushed an icepack into it while yanking the rags out of his mouth. “ Put that on your ear. It looks like that hurts</p>
<p>“Thonny,” Jack croaked, “leaf Nick alone.”</p>
<p>“Jack, wow, that’s so sweet. Look at you being a dad. Too late, even so, maybe I wasn’t wrong about you.” Sonny turned but stumbled, trying to catch himself as he knocked over the rolling table spilling the contents across the floor as he did.</p>
<p>“Shit, see what he did to me, Jack,” Sonny said, wincing as he bent down to retrieve the camera. “Alright, let’s have a good look at you,” he lifted Jack’s face, turning it side to side in his hands. Jack noted that Sonny’s hands were shaking and sweat covered his torso, despite his earlier claim. A knife appeared in Sonny’s hand with a flick of his wrist, Jack flinched as it cut his shirt off of him.</p>
<p>Breathing hard, Sonny snatched the ice pack and tossed it into the bowl on the floor. The Polaroid&rsquo;s flash left twin dots in Jack’s vision, Sonny clicked and waited for the undeveloped square to roll out of the bottom to the whirring of electric gears. He repeated the process several times, photographing Jack’s face and body from all angles.</p>
<p>“Hey Jack, you did great. I might take some more pictures in an hour or two if you show more color, sit tight.” He returned to the veranda, putting his shirt on as he went. Outside, Jack heard him sigh and groan as he sat.</p>
<p>The room was a mass of blurred edges and every breath seemed to trigger an earthquake. Jack was pondering what that might mean when he heard Sonny speaking again. With an effort he looked up, squinting to force the scene to clear.</p>
<p>Sonny was on a large cordless phone, the antenna extending an arm’s length over his head. “Carter, Sonny here.”</p>
<p>“Better every week. Actually, I am back to work on our case and I have an update.”</p>
<p>“Oh, you heard about that? No, he is still too cagey, but I have an ace up my sleeve.”</p>
<p>“Can you and a team join me here in New Orleans?”</p>
<p>“Nothing just roughed up Jack a little for the camera. I am having NOPD post some air time and flyers with the pics. If what you said about this kid is true, he will come to me to save his dad.”</p>
<p>“He’s a nobody Holland, we’ll see. Just get down here, I need back up I trust.”</p>
