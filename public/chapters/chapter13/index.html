<h1>Chapter 13</h1>

<br><br>
<p>Holland stood looking down at the street from the window in the conference room. He could see Sonny seated on the edge of the desk with one leg off the ground reflected behind him. &ldquo;The week has come and gone. What is Jack saying about this inability to produce his son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he is telling me he hasn&rsquo;t had time to meet with him. He says he&rsquo;s been busy with school and Nick hasn&rsquo;t been at home to answer his calls. The few times anybody has answered there they have said that Nick is working. Supposedly he&rsquo;s been picking up a lot of extra shifts at the restaurant now that he&rsquo;s not at school during the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holland turned around to lean against the window. The cold that seeped into his body through the glass felt like an ice pack as he relaxed into it with a sigh. Things were dragging on longer than they should which was bound to lead to trouble. He closed his eyes and let his head fall back into the cool touch of the glass. When he opened them again it was to stare at the white tiles of the acoustic ceiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try again,&rdquo; he said looking back down at Pera. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t get another suggestion from me like this, but you should take your friend Jack out for a night on the town. Get him drunk and find out what he knows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, I can do.&rdquo; Pera stood up from the table straightening his jacket, &ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well if he&rsquo;s been working extra shifts, he should be easy enough to track down. I&rsquo;m going to start across the street.” He took a step away from the glass and copying Pera&rsquo;s motion straitened his own jacket. &ldquo;Looks like we both get to have a little fun tonight.&rdquo; He said with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really like Arab food that much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Persian, it says so right under the name. You don&rsquo;t eat Catholic food, you eat Italian, and yes I do like it that much. I think it will be the only thing I miss about this town we’re finally done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a busy Friday night at the restaurant and Holland had no choice but to take one of the small tables in the bar area. A wide-faced man with pockmarked brown skin ruled the lounge with the broad smile and prompt service. “Good evening Sir, my name is Mustafa. Would you like to hear the specials?&rdquo; His accent was heavy but his tone was precise without being formal.</p>
<p>Out in the dining room, Holland could see the maître d' and Banu hurrying about as they served the guests. There was no sign of Nick although there were several other people in the kitchen with Ali. He decided to take his time with the meal. “No specials tonight Mustafa, but let me start with a Shirazi Salad, some hummus, and some pita.” He knew that sometimes Nick would help out when it was busy with luck he would turn up.</p>
<p>“Of course sir,” Mustafa replied with a flourish.</p>
<p>Holland sat so that he could see as much of the dining room as possible. Momentary relief turned to disappointment when he realized the dark-haired young man carrying appetizers to the table was not Nick. He did recognize the young man from surveillance photos taken at the high school. &ldquo;You must be new here, what&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my first week, my name is Ken. Are you a regular or something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something like that, where&rsquo;s the other kid, Nick? He didn&rsquo;t get fired or anything did he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy took a half step backward chin drawing down in surprise. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s none of my business,&rdquo; he said while turning with a fast step to leave.</p>
<p>After diner the young man returned to bus the table and Holland tried again. “I didn&rsquo;t mean to freak you out earlier. My name is Carter and I am a regular Ken. I come a lot for lunch on Saturday and Nick usually takes care of me. I figured you guys must be friends since you are about the same age. Did he get you the job here?&quot;</p>
<p>The young man looked down at him still holding the tub full of dirty dishes. There was a light sheen of sweat showing on his brow and his upper lip. ”Uh, yeah,” he muttered as he retreated.</p>
<p>Holland turned around to get the bartender’s attention, &ldquo;the new kid is not much of a talker. I like the other one better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the other one,&rdquo; the man asked while cocking his head and handing Holland the dessert menu.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,” he said taking the menu. “You know Nick. The other kid who runs dishes and helps out around here. I was just saying that he&rsquo;s friendlier than the new kid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well if it&rsquo;s friendly you want, look no further than Mustafa.&rdquo; He spread his arms, &ldquo;no one is friendlier than me. So do you need a moment? Would you like to order dessert?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will try the Sholeh Zard and can I have an Old Fashion with Makers Mark?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course sir, I will get that for you right away.&rdquo; Mustafa retreated into the dining room for a moment and then returned to the bar. As he prepared the old-fashioned, Holland stepped up to the bar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nick didn&rsquo;t get fired, did he? I thought Ali and Banu were happy with his work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nick, no, he is on vacation. I&rsquo;m sure he will be back soon. How do you know him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know him. We have had some excellent conversations though. It&rsquo;s much quieter on the weekends when I come for lunch. He&rsquo;s an unusual kid, in a good way. You can tell he has a future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mm-hmm, here is your drink sir,&rdquo; he put the tumbler down with a mock bow. &ldquo;Let me go check on your dessert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holland returned to his seat and took a slow drink from the glass. He let the sweetened bourbon run across to his tongue as he swirled it in his mouth before swallowing. It was a treat, Holland rarely drank. Or for that matter participated in self-indulgence as he saw it. Tonight he was enjoying the freedom that came with knowing the assignment was coming to an end.</p>
<p>Mustafa was a long time in returning and the glass was all but empty when he did. The bartender walked past Holland without a glance going straight to the bar. Ali followed a moment later with the desert. He placed it down in front of Holland with a smile and a small bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Carter, I did not see you come in. I was beginning to think you had been reassigned elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The phrase “reassigned” tore the relaxation from him like a slap to the face. &ldquo;Reassigned? No, I&rsquo;ve just been busy. So have you by the looks of things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, business is good, especially on Friday and Saturday nights. You should come more often. There will be belly dancers here later tonight and tomorrow we some real Persian music and dancing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>“I had no idea. I may have to stay for a while and watch. Now, what you mean reassigned?&quot;</p>
<p>“I thought you work for the government with the FBI. You know those guys come in here all the time. They tell me that they are at the whim of the Bureau for the first decade of their career are so. You fit the profile, dining alone, the way you dress, all of it. I did not mean to offend you, my apologies. So what do you do for a living Mr. Carter?”</p>
<p>&ldquo;No offense taken, it&rsquo;s kind of cool actually. I&rsquo;m a union rep and I work for the school board so pretty boring. The FBI though, that would be cool, but I guess you&rsquo;re kind of right, the school board is state government.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not fool yourself That is honorable work, you look out for the interests of teachers. That is cool.&rdquo; He said the last word with extra emphasis, &ldquo;enjoy the Sholeh Zard Mr. Carter.&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s smile never wavered but there was an icy chill to his gaze as he retreated to whisper something in Mustafa&rsquo;s ear. The Bartender eyed Holland as he listened.</p>
<p>Well, that doesn&rsquo;t bode well for getting any more information out of them today. It would seem as if our friend Ali knows something, and if he knows something he must&rsquo;ve heard it from Nick.</p>
<p>Holland made to leave half rising in his seat as he took a bite of the creamy dessert. He paused midway to standing, mouth working the soft grains of Saffron pudding. A warm sensation was spreading through him. He settled back down to take another bite, a crooked grin pulling at the corner of his mouth.</p>
<p>“It is good isn&rsquo;t it?&quot; Mustafa asked as he picked up the empty plate, &ldquo;would Sir like another drink?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the hell, why not. Is there a payphone here? Or one that I can use?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are more than welcome to use the bar phone,&rdquo; he gestured to a phone on the wall at the end of the bar. He returned to make another drink but stopped pulled the phone down and set it on the edge of the bar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; Holland offered as he picked up the receiver and dialed Sonny&rsquo;s pager. He pulled a laminated index card from his pocket and studied the pager code printed on it before lifting the receiver. At the tone, he typed in 1510-61101,(kid–awol), and hung up. He picked up the receiver and dialed again this time keying 91154-46120,(push–hard). It was in Pera&rsquo;s hands now whether he liked it or not. He opened his wallet as he returned to the bar to take the drink. &ldquo;Mustafa the service has been excellent tonight and the food was a delight as always, how much do I owe you?”</p>
<p>Holland waited in the sunlit hallway of the Riverfront Marriott refusing to knock for the third time. He could hear Pera on the other side cursing under his breath and stumbling around.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 10:30 in the morning, he must&rsquo;ve been out late. I hope he has the goods.</p>
<p>The door opened, the room inside was dim and smelled of artificial fruit and cigarette smoke. Pera wore a rumpled and stained blue button-down half-tucked into his boxers. His face was swollen, eyes squinting into the brightness of the hallway. He stepped out and pulled the door closed behind him.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got someone in there with him.</p>
<p>Pera swayed a little placing a hand on the wall to steady himself, &ldquo;Holland, what time is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s 10:30 in the morning, do you need me to come back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He watched the other man scrunch his face tight and then yawn while he mumbled something and shook his head. &ldquo;Sorry, no I&rsquo;m okay. Jack thinks the kid went back to Medford. He was a little standoffish last night.&rdquo; He pushed his hand over his eyes then wiped his cheek before squinting into the light of the hallway. &ldquo;Jane might be worth pursuing. Jack is either covering or he doesn&rsquo;t know. Either way, he&rsquo;s spent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should I wait for you to get presentable or should I track down Jane Starr and see what I can get out of her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>“Go on ahead, it&rsquo;s going take me more than a minute. What about you, did you learn anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&quot; I did, I learned Nick&rsquo;s boss knows something, I think the kid has gone AWOL. Or did you forget that I messaged you last night? Nevermind it doesn&rsquo;t matter. The old man at the restaurant had me pegged for Fed and still lied straight to my face. My bet is that something tipped off Nick, Jack most likely. I guess I misjudged him. Get yourself together to follow up on the Medford lead. I&rsquo;ll check in with Mrs. Starr.&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got it, I was getting tired of this town anyway. &quot; he turned to push the door open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agent Pera, if we&rsquo;ve lost him completely this is going to be bad for both of us. If we come up empty and no one reports him missing it&rsquo;s going to be very difficult to find him.&rdquo; Sonny stopped in the doorway to staring at the floor for a moment before turning around to respond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll come up with something. He can&rsquo;t be that hard to find, he is 14 and if he has left town like you say, then he just gave up his only source of cash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe. He&rsquo;s our guy, I know it. We can&rsquo;t rule anything out from now on. Meet me at the office tonight at six, will go over our next steps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holland watched the two preteen wrestlers line up across from each other once again. The awkward exuberance and lack of coordination reminded him of basic training. Or maybe it was just the smell of sweat and testosterone in the air. His mind wandered from that to his recruitment to the CIA. Not for the first time he questioned his path in life. The Army had its problems, but it had been a decent career. If he had stayed on a while longer may have been able to retire into civilian life to raise a family.</p>
<p>He cast aside his reverie and scanned the pullout wooden benches until he found her. A small dark-haired woman that he recognized from photos. She sat smiling and cheering, pumping her fists with vigor. She was attractive and even from across the room exuded a personable energy.</p>
<p>Jack Starr appears to be something of a fool, not that I hadn&rsquo;t guessed that.</p>
<p>He made his way up and squeezing in front of a few people, sat down next to her. &ldquo;Which one is your boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one in the red.&rdquo; She said without turning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much of a resemblance between him and his brother is there Mrs. Starr?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her head snapped to his with sudden focus. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No I&rsquo;m sorry, I should have introduced myself. My name is James Johnson, I work for CPS.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As in child protective services?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes ma&rsquo;am, your older son Nick has been on our radar for a little while now. I&rsquo;ve been trying to reach him to do a well-child checkup. You are aware that he dropped out of high school?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, his dad and I fought about that. He did pass his GED though so this can&rsquo;t be a truancy issue right?.&rdquo; She was still watching the match in progress but raised her eyebrow at him. She made a small effort to turn her face toward him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just need to talk to Nick, to make sure that he&rsquo;s okay. It&rsquo;s standard procedure. My colleagues have already talked to his father who doesn&rsquo;t seem to know where he is. As a matter of fact, Jack is saying you won&rsquo;t tell him where Nick is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That bastard!&rdquo; The referee below blew his whistle and raised the Starr boy&rsquo;s hand. Jane stood to clap and cheer. As her younger son retreated off of the mat with his coach she turned back to Holland. &ldquo;First he has the audacity to go behind my back and sign the release and then he calls CPS on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ve missed understood me. Jack Starr did not call CPS on you, we just happened to find and talk to him before we could track you down. You&rsquo;re a busy woman. As I said this is a mandatory well-child check. In cases like these when a child has been cited in multiple reports. If he is then is withdrawn from school, we always investigate. Especially when surrounding an instance of violence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What instance of violence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The beginning of January just a few days before Nick withdrew from school. He beat up another boy after skipping class most of the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know anything about that. But Nick is in Medford with my father. He is studying to take the SAT tests. I can give you the number, but I think you need to show me some ID.”</p>
<p>He pulled the laminated ID badge by its lanyard from under his jacket and slipped it over his head to hand it to her. Jane held the card with both hands, her face unreadable. ”My dad&rsquo;s name is Danny Avery, he&rsquo;s well respected in the Medford area and he and Nick get along very well. I promise you that he is safe and sound Mr. Johnson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is good, I won&rsquo;t be needing that phone number. That’s out of my jurisdiction, we will have someone local check on him. We&rsquo;ll be in touch. Have a good day Mrs. Starr.”</p>
<p>Pera was waiting for him with his feet on the long table. He looked ready to fall asleep, arms crossed under his chin which rested on his chest. He yawned and stretched when Holland approached. “There you are. Looks like your only going to get part of your wish.&rdquo; He finished stretching and swiveled the chair around with a boyish grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll bite what do you mean part?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean we&rsquo;re getting out of Portland, but we&rsquo;re not exactly going somewhere better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me we&rsquo;re going back to Medford?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you didn&rsquo;t want me to lie to you either?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does headquarters have, how could they be ready to commit so soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sheriff C.W. Smith seems to have volunteered some information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of Pera&rsquo;s eyebrows arched upwards as the two men stared at each other for a long moment. Holland broke the silence, &ldquo;that seems…&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unlikely?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. What do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a lot. I made contact with headquarters within the hour after you left. I put in the request for cross-agency cooperation and received a call back sometime around noon. It was from Sheriff Smith himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holland could feel the prickling sensation of a spider walking up his spine. The sensation spreads to his temples and he could feel his ears burning. &ldquo;And what did the sheriff have to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sheriff confirmed that Nicholas Starr is in fact, staying with Danny Avery. Claimed that he could see Nick through the window as we were speaking. Said he was helping clear some land for pocket money and that Nick is looking for work in the area.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s headquarters saying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much as you guessed boss, they&rsquo;re tired of waiting. They want him in custody and submitted for examination ASAP.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, Medford, again. Do we have any backup?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two vans, a half dozen agents, and a private jet. We get confirmation then pick the place and time. The extraction crew is on standby for the next 72 hours. They can be on location in less than six hours of our call. It&rsquo;s your call, we can let them handle the snatch and grab if you don&rsquo;t want to get your hands dirty. I&rsquo;m packed and ready if you want to do this tonight.&rdquo; When Holland did not respond right away Pera cleared his throat. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t had much to do today except catch up on sleep and wait for you. Knowing you we could be on the road in as little as half an hour and have no problem driving straight through. We&rsquo;d be there around midnight you&rsquo;re welcome to sleep on the way.&rdquo;</p>
