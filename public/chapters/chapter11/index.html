<h1>Chapter 11</h1>

<br><br>
<p>Sonny watched Holland pouring over his notes, he lifted his eyes to glance across the table. &ldquo;Have you made the necessary preparations with Jack Starr?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean for tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I mean for tomorrow. We have two technicians and a doctor arriving in the morning. It would be more than embarrassing if the subject was otherwise unavailable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m picking Jack up myself, and before you say anything I told him I&rsquo;d be there at nine. I figured if he&rsquo;s good to go I will buy breakfast before we head up and if he isn&rsquo;t, I have an hour to play with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. I don&rsquo;t mean to bother you about it, but we can&rsquo;t afford any hiccups. Last few days I&rsquo;ve been feeling a lot of questions from headquarters. They&rsquo;re only going for this plan by a hair as it is. If anything goes wrong were getting get the &ldquo;apprehend at any cost&rdquo; order .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About that, I&rsquo;m still not sure why we just don&rsquo;t do it that way. I mean what&rsquo;s the big idea, why go through all these hoops? Don&rsquo;t get me wrong I like hanging out with Jack, I&rsquo;ve learned a lot and he&rsquo;s a pretty fun guy. I could think of a lot worse targets to cover with. But at the end of the day, this is costing money and time that I&rsquo;m not sure we can justify.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pera could see the muscles and Holland&rsquo;s jaws doing their little rhythmic dance as the man stood up. &ldquo;Did your parents not give you any affection when you were a child Pera? Do you care about any other human being on this planet outside of yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took two long strides to the window and turned around. &ldquo;Every time an argument of conscience should satisfy you, I get that blank stare. It tells me that the thought hasn&rsquo;t even occurred to you yet. If you had been calling the shots chances are the old man back in Medford and his wife would be dead by now. &ldquo;Disappeared&rdquo;,&rdquo; he pantomimed with air quotes. &ldquo;And now here you are ready to expose two more people to situations that cannot go public. Do you understand what that means Pera?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He opened his mouth to respond, but Holland stormed out of the conference room coffee mug dangling by a forefinger. The sound of muttering continued as he receded down the hallway. Pera looked down at the paper Holland had been fidgeting with. The transcript from headquarters. Their request for cover clearance at the high school had been denied. The reasons cited unnecessary exposure and uncertainty of actionable surveillance.</p>
<p>Holland had been trying to get placed in the school to keep an eye on Nick. It&rsquo;d been a week since the two of them had come up with the current plan and now that they were about to start, he had his doubts. For one, he worried he was going to lose Jack if he kept stringing him along. And then he&rsquo;d received a tip from someone back at headquarters. His contact had said Holland intended to submit him for a behavioral review. They had hinted there may even be a formal complaint. He had cut off the evenings out with Jack when he learned that. The excuses he offered he couldn&rsquo;t even remember.</p>
<p>Yesterday he&rsquo;d been to visit Jack at the physics lab in Science Building Number One. Jack seemed standoffish and was unwilling to show him around. Instead, he&rsquo;d ushered Sonny out into the hallway to talk. Jack had seemed hesitant about the tests they were planning to run that coming Saturday.</p>
<p>In the end, he had won Jack over with a promise to take him out after they finished at the university hospital. &ldquo;One of the main reasons we haven&rsquo;t been able to hang out lately is because I didn&rsquo;t want to mess up your bloodwork.&rdquo; Jack had seemed to latch onto that excuse, his face brightened for a moment then fell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, my girlfriend and I have been fighting about nothing every day since I left the family.&rdquo; He let the comment hang there not following up while he stuck his lower lip out like a child. Pera had chuckled and given him a light tap on the shoulder with a closed fist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we can always find you a new one.&rdquo; He replied with a wink.</p>
<p>The white coffee mug with the blue logo clanked down onto the table across from him. Holland settled into his chair a half-second later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look Pera, I know your dad and his brothers all have their fingers in the game back at headquarters. You&rsquo;re destined to sit in the inner circle someday. Lord knows I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tilted back in the chair to look at the ceiling. &quot; In the meantime, however, I am responsible for making sure you&rsquo;re ready. What we do, and I don&rsquo;t mean where we get placed. I mean what we do in the background…&quot;</p>
<p>He brought himself forward with his elbows on the table to look Pera in the eyes. &ldquo;What we do matters. But, it&rsquo;s up to every man in the field to cut that balance. The one that threads the needle between two sometimes juxtaposed objectives. On the one hand, the mission directives. On the other the risk of exposing our very secretive organization.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Long seconds stretched, &quot; I wouldn&rsquo;t be part of this group if I thought it was, well… Evil. I believe that we do good work. But you have to understand something. Some in this organization worry more about remaining in the shadows than collateral damage. Even if that damage is the life of a few civilians or even an entire family. So that&rsquo;s my responsibility for the time being. I need to make sure you&rsquo;re ready to shoulder that responsibility.&quot;</p>
<p>Pera felt his cheeks burning, &ldquo;I am ready, even if you don&rsquo;t think that I am. I&rsquo;ve heard from headquarters that you&rsquo;re making behavioral inquiries. I hope you realize, not everyone possesses the same Puritanical morals that you do Holland. I am perfectly capable of maintaining a full social life that does not interfere with my job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not how I read it. Do you know what I used to do for the CIA?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only what people talk about, that you&rsquo;re some kinda deep cover badass. That you specialize in hard to get at foreign targets. This isn&rsquo;t a hostile arena Holland it&rsquo;s my home turf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not how I would describe it, but for all intents and purposes it is close enough.&rdquo; He replied, ignoring the challenge. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been active overseas in three years, but I haven&rsquo;t gotten rusty. You don&rsquo;t ever get rusty when your life hangs in the balance of how you read people Pera. You may think you&rsquo;re ready, but you&rsquo;re not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holland took a long swig of coffee without breaking eye contact. Pera had to look away. He took a deep breath and opened his mouth but Holland continued cutting him off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever games you may play in the background you need to understand this. The intuition that built me a reputation for fieldwork is one of the reasons why you&rsquo;re with me now. You can try to work around me all you want. As I said, we both know you will pass me eventually. But only if I say you get to move on from here. Your father, your uncles, even your god damn grandfather will listen. They will all take my word for it if I tell them you&rsquo;ll get yourself killed. You understand me, Pera? This is not a fucking joke!&rdquo; He set the now empty coffee cup down with a bang, causing Pera to jump.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now go on, get out of here. Get some rest. Enjoy that social life. But remember we&rsquo;re playing by my rules from here out Pera. This is for your own good. You may not see it. I may be peppering that truth on occasion. It isn&rsquo;t to thwart you. Its hope that you will rise to the occasion and be someone who will make me proud of being in this organization. Now go on, tomorrow at 10, McKenzie Hall parking, the lab tech will meet you there. Jack will do bloodwork and then do the psych eval. The CAT scan is all the way over on the other side of the campus and our technician will need some time to get it set up anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, call you tomorrow if anything comes up.&rdquo; Pera picked up his bag and took the stairs to the ground floor.</p>
<p>Outside he turned and walked toward the waterfront. Acid bubbled in his gut, he wanted to hit something. Under the shadowy recesses of the Hawthorne Bridge, he stopped. The constant rhythmic noise of cars passing overhead dominated the space. His eyes darted amongst the shadowy recesses of the concrete pylons. When he was satisfied no one was there he began to punch and kick the air. He screamed at the top of his lungs until he collapsed, his hands on his knees breathing hard. He straightened, loosening his tie, and looked once more for any onlookers.</p>
<p>Jack opened the door, &ldquo;Sonny, Jesus you&rsquo;re soaked. Come on in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Sonny?&rdquo; A dark-haired woman asked. She looked him up and down, faced pinched, &ldquo;do you really work for the government?&rdquo; She retreated to the kitchen throwing Jack an evil stare on the way by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, but you do look a mess.&rdquo; He ducked down the hall and threw Pera a towel. &ldquo;The bathroom&rsquo;s here, there are some razors in the drawer and…&rdquo; He tossed something small. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a fresh robe. Mary is making breakfast, get cleaned up. I can toss your clothes the dryer while we eat.&rdquo; Para-looked down at the small object, it was Visine.</p>
<p>There was a cup of coffee and a beer waiting by the plate of eggs. Jack and Mary were already eating. The robe felt two sizes too big as he sat down and took the beer.</p>
<p>Jack was staring out the window as they wound their way up the twisting road to OHSU. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Mary approved of drinking at breakfast. She doesn&rsquo;t like most people when she first meets them. I think you won her over though.&ldquo;Jack went back to staring out the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the beer helped and so did the dry clothes. Thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right, well you&rsquo;re getting cleaned up helped you know, with Mary. I didn&rsquo;t tell her anything specific you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good, anyway you won&rsquo;t have to worry about it for much longer. Today is the first step of getting your official clearance.&rdquo; They continued to the top of the hill in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here. You&rsquo;ll be having some blood drawn first. The lab tech will escort you from here. I will meet up with you after your psych eval to get some lunch. We&rsquo;ll head over to the imaging lab after that.&rdquo; The car came to a stop and a thin man in a white lab coat opened the door for Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Starr, my name is Ethan if you would follow me please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sonny let himself into the small observation room giving his eyes a moment to adjust to the dim interior. There was an illuminated area, a desk pushed against the one-way glass. The room on the other side was full of natural light that spilled through.</p>
<p>Sitting down he studied the silent conversation in progress on the other side of the glass. A rigid-backed woman in a deep navy blazer sat with her back to the glass. Her black hair was tied in place with an ornate hairpin. Across a large white desk sat Jack. His hands were on the table as he stared at several pictures arranged in front of him.</p>
<p>The observation room was several feet higher than the room it faced. From his seated position Parra could look down and see the photos on top of the desk. One contained what looked to be intricate gears and clockwork mechanisms. Another appeared to be the corpse of a young woman killed in her bed. The photograph Jack was staring at appeared to be of some kind of mutilated animal.</p>
<p>Sonny looked around as his eyes adjusted. He found the switch on a bank of monitors and flipped them on. He found the volume knob and turned it up to hear the dialogue on the other side. A picture faded into view, on the screen he recognized Dr. Cynthia Blackwell. He felt his pulse quicken and his stomach do a small flip-flop. He didn&rsquo;t know her but by reputation. Her name was akin to the bogeyman in certain circles. Dr. Blackwell was pioneering the field of criminal psychological profiling. A former professor of psychology and one of the few women that belong to the inner sanctum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Jack&rsquo;s voice came through. &ldquo;Intrigued maybe. … It doesn&rsquo;t bother me. I&rsquo;m more curious about why it&rsquo;s mixed in with the rest of the photographs that I am worried about what&rsquo;s in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you worried about how I might perceive your reactions, Mr. Starr?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, but then again that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re here isn&rsquo;t it? For you to assess my reactions, so why wouldn&rsquo;t I be a little curious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Starr many people have strong emotional reactions to the images. However, if I were merely reading your vital signs I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to tell that you&rsquo;d looked at a single one yet. Why do you think that is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I know it&rsquo;s a game of sorts, and I know that you know it&rsquo;s a game. Once I saw you bring out the photographs I mentally prepared myself for anything that might be on them. It&rsquo;s like when you watch a movie, you know it&rsquo;s not real, and if you want to enjoy it you have to make yourself commit. I&rsquo;m committing to the other direction right now. I&rsquo;m not interested in the drama but rather what it is telling me about the situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you always fancy yourself the smartest man in the room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no reason to lie to me Mr. Starr, there is no wrong answer. Let me ask you again, do you usually feel like you are the smartest person in the room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Usually, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you like that feeling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you ever find yourself playing games with other people&rsquo;s thoughts and emotions? To amuse yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack squirmed for a long moment in his chair before clearing his throat. &ldquo;Ahem, yeah. I get bored. I don&rsquo;t do it on purpose, not always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about your son Nicholas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nick? What about him? I didn&rsquo;t know we were going to be talking about that, I mean him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you play games with your son Nicholas to amuse yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you find him intellectually challenging?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nick is a smart kid, yes. Sometimes he&rsquo;s challenging. You know last month I thought he was going to get kicked out of school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack put the picture down and smiled. &ldquo;When he was a little guy he was always so talkative. Man, I could take them anywhere, and he would just talk to anyone. My friends were always like, &ldquo;your kid is far out man.&rdquo; But he&rsquo;s had a pretty rough couple of years though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You recently signed a consent form for him to withdraw from high school. Can you tell me what that&rsquo;s about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well like I said he&rsquo;s been having a hard time. He came to me, told me he didn&rsquo;t want to go to school anymore. High school. He&rsquo;s going to go to college. My kid is smart I didn&rsquo;t sign him out of high school to be a dropout, he took his GED the next day. He passed on the first try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Blackwell did nothing but enter notes and wait for Jack to continue. &ldquo;I did the same thing in my junior year. There&rsquo;s nothing to learn in high school. I wish I&rsquo;d done it in my freshman year too. Next week he&rsquo;s taking the SATs if he does as well on those as he did on the GED he could end up with a scholarship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did you know that this was his plan before you signed the consent form?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, Nick and I talk all the time, he confides in me. Like I said he&rsquo;s smart. So I guess getting back to your original question I don&rsquo;t always feel… I mean, I know I did play games with the boys when they were young. But Nick is one of the only people I can talk to now. &quot;</p>
<p>Jack shook his head after a pause, &ldquo;why are we talking about this, about him? Agent Pera said that I&rsquo;m getting a full-body scan after this. And I don&rsquo;t remember telling him the names of my kids, my wife maybe, but not my kids. Is all this standard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Standard for what Mr. Starr? Can you articulate what it is that you&hellip;&rdquo; Sonny turned the volume down to zero and dialed the phone number to the conference room at the Fed building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holland here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know why they denied your cover request. The kid pulled out of high school. He got his GED, sounds like yesterday. And he&rsquo;s going for his SAT and college entrance next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn! You said Jack&rsquo;s a physics guy right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to let them figure out that we are testing for high-energy particles and exposure to radiation. Don&rsquo;t come right out and tell him, let him figure it out for himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&quot; I don&rsquo;t know what else we can do from here but we need him to start coming up with theories. Once he latches onto one of them, feed it. If it&rsquo;s the Russians, then you are worried about Nick&rsquo;s exposure to a secret KGB plot. If it&rsquo;s aliens that&rsquo;s what the radiation tests are for. Whatever it is, we need him to bring that kid to us as soon as possible. If he doesn&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s going to be the snatch and grab. You may have been right after all and Pera.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mm-hmm. I think I follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry about earlier. I may have crossed the line, there&rsquo;s a lot of pressure on me to push you through. The downside for me is that if you screw up, you get a pass and I&rsquo;m going to get the boot. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why would they punish you for my failures?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pera, why would they give you to me in the first place?&rdquo;</p>
