<h1>Prologue</h1>

<br><br>
<p>The last day of Nickolas Starr&rsquo;s life was an ordeal that he could never forget. Every detail emblazoned onto the tapestry of his memory. Written there as if with an indelible cosmic marker. In his mind it would always start with the horrible vertigo of returning to his hospital bed. Each moment, feeling, and thought would come back to him from there.</p>
<p>The room was spinning. Not spinning like being dizzy. No, this was a slow churn. This was a black hole of despair. Sucking all the pain and remorse in the world inward in slow rhythmic waves to crush his chest.
He had practiced this feeling so many times. Alone at night, the onset of hopelessness would slip in. The futility of life. The certainty that death was waiting another few worthless memories away.
The first time he could remember it happening was as a boy. Somewhere in the awkward and in-between years of early teenhood. He had been standing on a beach and thunder clouds and wind had raced to the shore from out at sea. It had been magical. The excitement of that moment. He had imagined Zeus or Odin riding that cloud. The hair on his body had stood up everywhere with power and anticipation. He had screamed, with hope and self-aware desperation into that storm, &ldquo;pick me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The storm had rolled on. No lightning bolts and no magic.
A little ashamed he had made his way back to the group. It was a school trip, the other children playing games on the dunes while the adults started a fire on the beach. He had found a dune with tall grasses a few hundred feet away from the others and sat down to cry. He could remember the war that raged in that teenage chest. The certainty of both great destinies and lonely despair.
As the years went on the quiet moments of soul-crushing despair would attack without warning. Whenever things seemed to be going in the right direction. They would strike. Every smothering episode cooled that burning ember of great destiny a bit more.
It hadn&rsquo;t been that first night on the beach, but in that period of his life, he had made a pact with himself. The clarity and certainty of his death came with the understanding that in the end, it would all seem too short. That we die with our secret regrets hunting us.So he had made the pact, a solemn promise. From then on he would live for the old man he would be and live in a way that would let him be at peace when he died.
It hadn&rsquo;t worked.</p>
<p>He had done much, but the air was being pushed from his lungs and the world was darkening. He did have regret. He had lived an exciting life in his younger years and then settled down to contribute and raise a family. Yet, here at the end, it was that ember of destiny that burned with the undeniable agony.
&ldquo;You ignored me,&rdquo; it seemed to say. &ldquo;You took the easy roads.&rdquo; And in a way it was true. He had let the pack become about right and wrong. About being a &ldquo;good man,&rdquo; but in so doing he had not done more. It seemed that the world was dying with him.</p>
<p>Now as the black hole smothered him in his hospital bed, some better future was being lost. He could&rsquo;ve done more. He was crying, a slow constant stream, the room was a blur as he fell asleep perhaps for the last time.
A small hand was squeezing his accompanied by a timid but insistent voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandpa,&rdquo; squeeze,
&ldquo;grandpa,&rdquo; squeeze.</p>
<p>He opened his eyes to find a room full of faces. Some sad, some angry or annoyed, and some withdrawn or detached. His daughter Anna stood with her hand on the shoulder of the hand squeeze her, Ellie. He tried to move his other arm to take in his hand, but it more or less flopped on the bed. Somehow she knew what he wanted and stepped around from behind Ellie to sit by his side on the other side of the bed. She picked up his hand, he could see tears in her eyes. &ldquo;Dad,&rdquo; she managed to get out before the tears begin in earnest. He wanted to tell her so much, but he could only give a feeble squeeze. He gave one for Ellie too and managed a wink and a smile.
He looked around the room to see the faces were all so old now. His nieces and nephews were all grown, some graying already. Looking back at Anna he noticed she was alone, neither her spouse nor her brother seemed to be here. He lifted an eyebrow.&ldquo;Sam couldn&rsquo;t make it dad&rdquo;.
Anna and Ellie had stayed longer than the rest. Anna&rsquo;s wife showed up to take Ellie home. She&rsquo;d given the two of them a few minutes to go get something to eat from the cafeteria while she sat with Nicholas.&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to be lost for a while old man,&rdquo; Zahara said as she sat down. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think any of us believed you would ever die.&ldquo;He stared back at this woman who had become his friend over the last decade and smiled. Zahara wasn&rsquo;t the emotional type, but he could see a tear running down her nose. Somehow that tear banished the despair and he fell asleep with a smile.</p>
