<br><br>
<p>1985.01.21 Danny</p>
<p>Danny hung up the phone and looked across the kitchen at Jeannie. Her worry and concern reflected his own. &ldquo;Was that the sheriff,&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was, the men that Nick told us about our in town. They showed up early Sunday morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they coming here?&rdquo; Her worry lines deepened and she couldn&rsquo;t help but look out the window as she asked. &ldquo;I still don&rsquo;t understand who these guys are. Why are you and CW so sure that there is something fishy with them?”</p>
<p>&ldquo;First off CW is sure that they will be here soon. But to answer your question, it started as a hunch. According to our sheriff, these guys just don&rsquo;t add up. He said they act like Feds from a TV show more than any Fed he&rsquo;s ever met. Now he did offer the disclaimer that he&rsquo;s only had to cooperate with the feds a few times in his career. In the past, he received advanced warnings from either an agency&rsquo;s headquarters or Salem. Then there&rsquo;s the entire issue about what the hell they&rsquo;re looking for in the first place. Their story doesn&rsquo;t pan out in any kind of way that makes sense. &quot;</p>
<p>Unless that thing is responsible for Nick&rsquo;s flashforward, but even that seems thin. Unless it was actually looking into the future? But if that were the case, wouldn&rsquo;t Nick have seen these guys in it?</p>
<p>Jeanie broke in on his reflection, &ldquo;what was it they said they were looking for the first time they came through?&rdquo;</p>
<p>“You were there, CW told us that they told him it was a manhunt. Which both Sheriff Smith and I agree is ridiculous. Unless you count the one these two are on to find Nick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Nick is sure that it&rsquo;s the same two guys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;CW says he described them to a tee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they were with Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um-hmm and Nick said that they wanted Jack to bring him to them for some type of questioning or tests or something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>“Hells bells Danny, this is bonkers. So what now? We give them the run around for as long as they&rsquo;ll take it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the general idea. Nick bought himself a motorcycle and outfitted it with off-road tires. He&rsquo;s staying out at Applegate Lake area, only trails in and out. So he should be safe there. The idea is that he gets seen in town from time to time. He&rsquo;ll show up for a few public events in hopes that these agents get notified. But he&rsquo;s not going to be staying anywhere long enough for them to get to him. If these guys make their move in a public setting then CW thinks he can make a case against them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re sure it&rsquo;s safe for you and CW to go poking around? What if these guys are federal agents? Or worse what if they&rsquo;re not but they have the power and influence to pose as agents?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sheriff Smith has lots of connections. I have a few myself you know. If we can&rsquo;t figure out who these guys are between the two of us…&rdquo; He let the comet hang there in the air put his head in his hands. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But I believe Nick and whatever this is, we need to know before we let him put himself in danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just be careful Danny. I don&rsquo;t know what to make of any of it. You know I&rsquo;ve seen my share of crazy kids. Even as a small-town teacher I&rsquo;ve seen about every type of home situation and every type of lie you can imagine. Some of them are very convincing.&rdquo; She held her hand up palm facing him, &ldquo;no, no I&rsquo;m not saying I think Nick is lying, but you can&rsquo;t discount it. Although, I wouldn&rsquo;t think somebody like CW could be snookered by a 14-year-old. Even if that kid is Nick with his convincing charm.&rdquo; She looked as though she was about to say more but both of the dogs stood to full attention at the same time. A deep rumble was growing outside.</p>
<p>It turned into the distinctive rhythmic thumping of a helicopter as it drew nearer the cabin. The dogs wined and circled the living room. The sound continued for long minutes passing over the house several times before receding.</p>
<p>They could still hear the helicopter circling somewhere in the distance when the phone rang. They shared a look, Jeannie&rsquo;s eyes seem to say &ldquo;I told you so.&rdquo; Danny picked up the receiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Avery residence.?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Danny, this is CW. They&rsquo;re going around me. They&rsquo;re working with Medford PD, one of my old deputies is over there. He called to tell me they flew your way in a chopper about ten minutes ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, they&rsquo;re flying around out here right now, thanks for the update Sheriff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your head down and stick to the plan. I&rsquo;ve started asking questions and the bullshit is already piling up. This Miami Vice routine there pulling won&rsquo;t last. I&rsquo;m looking at a memo right now that says Carter Holland is on loan as part of an inter-agency task force from the CIA. That son of a bitch showed me an FBI badge when he was here last month.”</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think this has a cartel connection?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? What are you getting at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said something about a Florida vice squad, what do they have to do with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you watch TV Danny? It&rsquo;s Miami Vice and it&rsquo;s a TV show. It came out last year, sometimes we watch it at the JCSS. Everyone has been getting a kick out of it. Anyway, the main characters are two vice cops in Miami, a white guy, and a black guy. It&rsquo;s all glitz and the cops are always dressed real fancy like these two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry I missed the reference. Are you still planning to meet with Nick on Wednesday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless something changes I&rsquo;m planning on having him meet me over on Griffin Creek Road. We will stop at the post office in Phoenix. Then get some lunch in Grants Pass before heading to the sheriff&rsquo;s station. I&rsquo;ll be sure that he&rsquo;s seen by a few of the deputies before I drop him off on the way to your place. Keep your head down Danny, I&rsquo;ll be in touch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roger that Sheriff, thank you.&rdquo; He hung up the receiver and realized that he could no longer hear the helicopter. Jeannie was making eyeballs at him from across the counter. &ldquo;Sheriff Smith has informed me that our friends are now working with the Medford PD. The one in charge that claimed to be from the FBI last time. This time it&rsquo;s the CIA. The effort is now an official interagency task force.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this at all, maybe I should go stay at my mother&rsquo;s house.&rdquo; Her jaw was set, it had been a statement. He looked at her furrowed brow and pleading eyes and knew she was bluffing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now why would you want to go into that? We have to keep doing our normal day-to-day and act like nothing has changed. Once or twice a day I&rsquo;ll put on the winter parka Nick uses and ride the ATV around the property. If we are right about these guys, they&rsquo;ll show up here expecting to find him at some point. When they do, they&rsquo;ll have played their hand and CW will take it from there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>“Fine, I never could say no to you. But if this is the plan I&rsquo;m going to be getting some work out of you old man. We still need to repair the stables from the storm. Plus, you promised me that we could run a second driveway to the arena.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got it dear,&rdquo; he said with a smile as he gave her a kiss on the forehead.</p>
<p>Well, that didn&rsquo;t take as long as I thought it would. They must have had eyes on the sheriff after all. Danny mused as the two-lane road exploded with red and blue light. The air was a riot with the sound of engines roaring and sirens screaming. Two Medford police interceptors skidded to a stop, blocking the road ahead. A black sedan and a large white transport Van had pulled out from hidden locations behind him and closed in.</p>
<p>He slowed and stopped in front of the roadblock. All-around vehicle doors flew open. In front, four police officers moved to stand behind their doors guns ready. While behind him, six men in black tactical gear poured out the van. Danny lifted his hands over his head not trusting himself to say anything yet. His heart hammered in his chest as the men in black split into two groups going separately to his left and his right. When everyone was in position around him two men stepped out of the sedan.</p>
<p>He recognized them immediately from their descriptions. They were both muscled like Olympic athletes under their tailored charcoal gray suits. They had matching navy blue ties over their white button-down shirts. The man named Holland made his way around the front of the car. &ldquo;All right, No sudden moves. Nice and easy. Let&rsquo;s take off that helmet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danny took a deep breath to calm his nerves as he placed his hands on the side of the helmet and lifted it off of his head. The man named Holland turned his back and cursed under his breath. No one said anything for long moments as they waited until he turned around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Avery I presume?&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s face was unreadable as he stood assessing Danny in a cold stare. All at once, he turned to inscribe a circle in the air with his forefinger, &ldquo;put him in the back. I get that vehicle off the road, I don&rsquo;t want anybody seeing it until we&rsquo;re ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Someone took the helmet from him and then rough hands were lifting Danny by either arm. He was carried feet dangling like a child and tossed into the back of the van. One of the men that had been carrying him threw a pair of handcuffs onto the ground next to him. &ldquo;Get up onto the bench there loop these through the hook handcuff yourself to it,&rdquo; he ordered.</p>
<p>Danny had no choice but to follow the directions given. When seated with hands cuffed between his legs the man nodded in satisfaction. The man took one large step into the van and sat on the bench opposite him. He couldn&rsquo;t make out any details of the conversations outside but did hear the ATV as it drove away.</p>
<p>Now that the initial shock had worn off Danny was beginning to lose patience. &ldquo;What the hell is this about?&rdquo; The man opposite him did not so much as blink in response. &ldquo;Hey out there,&rdquo; Danny bellowed, &ldquo;what the hell is going on?&rdquo; He began to stomp on the floor of the van. He kept at it, yelling for attention until the man across from him got up and left the van. Danny was out of breath, throwing a temper tantrum was not something that you did in your 60s very often.</p>
<p>As he recovered his breathing, he realized that he could make out bits of the conversation outside. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Danny Avery you got in there, I can&rsquo;t let you drive off with him. We are here to help you apprehend Nicholas Starr, not Danny Avery.&rdquo; The voices were growing clearer as they approached the van.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Officer you&rsquo;re here to help me in any way that I see fit, I thought your captain made that clear.&rdquo; The sound of footsteps retreating then, &quot; That&rsquo;s a wrap, everybody load up.&quot; Holland came into view as all six men in black tactical gear men piled into the back with Danny.</p>
<p>Holland closed the door pounding twice on the back of the van. The engine started and the van immediately began to move. The drive turned out to be a short one. Judging by the number of turns or lack thereof, Danny guessed they were still near the main road.</p>
<p>The door opened into the dim interior of a barn. Again the men lifted him by the arms and carried him to a plastic foldout picnic table. There was no sign of the Medford police. Jeannie&rsquo;s fears were creeping around the edges of his awareness.</p>
<p>Who the hell are these people? This Landon Miller&rsquo;s barn, the same place they met CW. Have they been here the whole time?</p>
<p>The men pushed Danny down into a chair as the two well-dressed agents walked around the table. Holland placed a slim leather-bound case on the end and seated himself across from Danny. He spent a moment aligning the case with the edges of the table before opening it. Then removing a notepad, pen and a manila envelope he asked, &ldquo;did you and Sheriff Smith come up with this little ruse together?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I demand to know what the hell&rsquo;s going on here?&rdquo; Danny put all the fear he was feeling into his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Avery, I&rsquo;ll tell you when you can make demands. &ldquo;He spoke with a measured cadence and deliberate annunciation. &ldquo;In the meantime, answer my question. Did you and Sheriff Smith mislead the joint task force led by myself and agent Pera here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where am I? Am I under arrest? If you&rsquo;re not going to arrest me or play nice, I&rsquo;ll be leaving now.&rdquo; Danny stood up and turned around to find the barn doors closed and guarded by the other men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down Mr. Avery. You were a Marine, right? So you should know how to do what you&rsquo;re told. Enough games, you know we are looking for Nick don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; he answered while sitting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how did you come by this information? Was it from Sheriff Smith or from Nicholas himself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danny looked at the men in front of him as he sat back down. On his left was a good-looking, fidgety young man in his 30s. His face looked haggard and his eyes bruised. Now that Danny had the image of Sonny Crocket, thanks to CW, he couldn&rsquo;t shake the comparison. The young man could pass as an FBI agent, but not by much. His sandy brown bangs hung over his forehead on one side, on the other side his hair swept back to cover his ears. There was a hint of vanity in the young man&rsquo;s eyes that said he worked hard for the look.</p>
<p>The other man by contrast was calm, he showed no outward appearance of motion other than breath. He was older, 40-something, but Danny wasn&rsquo;t sure he was good at judging anymore. He had been out in the very un-diverse rural Pacific Northwest for too long. Holland&rsquo;s short hair showed only a hint of gray, but it was his eyes that grabbed Danny&rsquo;s attention. Unlike his partner, this man&rsquo;s eyes managed warmth even as they pierced their target. Danny stared at him for a moment and found himself feeling kind of kinship with him. In different circumstances, Danny was certain that he would enjoy this man&rsquo;s company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a tough question to answer Mr. Holland.&rdquo; He showed no reaction to his name, but Danny heard a small inrush of breath from the other one. &ldquo;You see Sheriff Smith told me there was something fishy about you guys from the get-go. He didn&rsquo;t come right out and say it last time you were here. But it must have bothered him. We&rsquo;ve known each other a long time, so he made his doubts known .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now that he talking, a sense of relief spread through him. But, that you are looking for my grandson, that came from Nick himself. Told me that you&rsquo;ve been working with Jack Starr. Overheard the plan for Jack to turn him over to you guys for some kind of testing. The problem with that comes when you combine that with what CW said. Plus Nick figured out that you have been following him for over a month now. So he didn&rsquo;t feel like coming for testing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Avery, is Nicholas Starr staying with you right now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally, there was some human reaction from the man across the table. The muscles in his lower jaw were bunching on budging in half-second intervals. Danny decided to give Holland the truth, &ldquo;no he is not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When was the last time you saw your grandson, Mr. Avery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last Wednesday.&rdquo; During the war, Danny had come to believe that you only really learn who people are when they are on the line. A belief that the intervening years strengthened. What he could see that the man on the other side of the table was on the line now. Danny could tell that Holland was angry, but he did not feel that the anger directed at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Avery this could be done a whole lot faster if you would tell me everything you know. But you&rsquo;re not going to do that are you? You&rsquo;re going to make you ask and bake for every piece of information. And the worst part is, I can&rsquo;t say that I blame you. In fact, I get it, you&rsquo;re looking out for your family. But there is something you seemed to have missed. Nick is in danger and that&rsquo;s the truth. He&rsquo;s involved in things he can&rsquo;t possibly understand. Sooner or later, if he&rsquo;s lucky, he&rsquo;s gonna end up right where you are. Sitting across from me answering questions. If he&rsquo;s not lucky it won&rsquo;t be me and he won&rsquo;t be answering questions. He will be on a table in restraints then&hellip;&rdquo; The man lifted his hands in the air, &ldquo;nobody wants to see it come to that, but that&rsquo;s where this is going.&rdquo; Somewhere he registered that the man had not asked another question. His heart twisted in his chest as they stared at each other in silence.</p>
<p>Movement on his left caught his eye as the other man slammed his hand onto the table and stood up. He stomped around behind Danny&rsquo;s chair and kicked the back of it, sending him sprawling to the ground. He had had little time to brace himself and now he was trying to catch his breath. He was struggling to regain the air that the frozen earth had knocked from his lungs. The man at his side picked the chair back up and set it down again. Standing over Danny he extended a hand.</p>
<p>Danny tried to push himself up on his own but his right arm felt numb and wouldn&rsquo;t respond. He took the offered hand and the other man lifted him. He settled Danny into his seat and brushed off his shoulders. Then he whispered into Danny&rsquo;s ear, &ldquo;you had better start cooperating or next time I&rsquo;m not kicking the chair. Do you understand me, old man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danny waved one hand in affirmation, massaging his shoulder with the other. , &ldquo;I understand.&rdquo; As he felt the extent of the impact he looked back across the table. There was a hardness in the eyes of Holland. A flicker of contempt or displeasure showing as he watched the younger man return to his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know where Nicholas is,&rdquo; Holland asked levelly?</p>
<p>“I do not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s a plan in place to meet him isn&rsquo;t there?&rdquo; Danny didn&rsquo;t even have the time to answer before the other man continued, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what I thought. Your face says it all. But I&rsquo;m guessing we could beat on you and you either keep lying to me or end up dead. Mr. Avery, I have every confidence that you will immediately inform Sheriff Smith and warn Nick if I let you go. So I don&rsquo;t have much in the way of options, do I? Tell me, Danny, what you think will happen when you don&rsquo;t come back from your ride?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The world seemed to open up beneath him and Danny felt like he was spinning in his chair. He tried to reconcile the man with kind eyes to the threat that he was hearing. He told himself that nothing bad would happen, that this man was not the type. It didn&rsquo;t help his nerves any. He fought to find the words to answer. To say anything that might stave off where this was heading, but instead, he stared mutely at the other man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Avery I want you to write a note on this pad to Sheriff Smith. I want to say that you&rsquo;ve driven back to Portland to visit Jane because she&rsquo;s having a hard time with the separation. Don&rsquo;t try to sneak in any hints to your friend. After you write the note, you and I will drive to your cabin. You are going to pack a bag and get your wife and let my men take you to a safe house. I am going to get what I want.&rdquo; Holland finished pushing the notepad and pen over to Danny. &ldquo;Pera, get on with headquarters and get a secure room booked somewhere nice. No more than an hour away, I want to be able to produce Mr. Avery and his wife if we need to.&rdquo; He turned to look back at Danny with a raised eyebrow.</p>
<p>It was a leap of faith, but Danny couldn&rsquo;t shake the feeling that he could trust this man even if it was only a little bit. He put his pen to the paper and began to write.</p>
