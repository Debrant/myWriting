<h1>Chapter 16</h1>

<br><br>
<p>&ldquo;I was beginning to think you weren&rsquo;t as smart as I gave you credit for,&rdquo; Holland said from the shadows as the sheriff stepped into the entryway of the barn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t see much reason to come poking around in the middle of the night. Where are the Avery&rsquo;s?&rdquo; The sheriff hadn&rsquo;t moved any further into the barn, his hand rested on his sidearm. Holland stepped out into a square patch of sunlight. The golden light stretching from the door to reach the middle of the barn, leaving the rear of the barn in shadow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. and Mrs. Avery are safe.  They are enjoying and all expenses paid mini-vacation, courtesy of the joint task force.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What exactly is the power behind that task force Mr. Holland?&rdquo; The sheriff surveyed the room but remained near the entrance. Holland walked to meet the taller man, regretting the decision immediately. Sheriff Smith had five or more inches on him. The bright morning light shone from behind him making a mountain of his silhouette. Holland said nothing, choosing to employ one of his favorite techniques, silence. The sheriff stared down at him for a moment longer before filling the silence as Holland had hoped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who do you work for Mr. Holland, is it the CIA or the FBI, or is it neither? At this point, nothing will surprise me. Excavating private land without a permit? While operating under the guise of a manhunt. Performing illegal surveillance on US citizens without warrants. Endangering a minor, do I need to go on? What&rsquo;s to stop me from arresting you right here?.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can do that if you choose sheriff, I won&rsquo;t try to stop you. I would be released within the hour and your career would suffer. But let&rsquo;s not pretend that is on the table, you wouldn&rsquo;t have come alone if it was.&rdquo; Holland waited for a nod that was slow to come. Now to answer a few of your questions sheriff, my permanent home is at the CIA. I retired from international service about three years ago. For the last 20 months, I have been on loan to the FBI as part of this joint task force. So you could say that I work for both of them. As for your other concerns…&quot;</p>
<p>He made his way back into the shaded interior of the barn sitting once more at the table that had become familiar. &ldquo;I could raise some of the same objections sheriff. Endangering a minor, interfering with a federal investigation, lying to a federal officer. Come have a seat, let&rsquo;s talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in here.&rdquo; The big man turned and walked out of the barn. Holland swore under his breath and pushed himself up off the table. Something had changed in the sheriff. He was going to have to figure out what that was to get the upper hand back. Being outmaneuvered made the hardened foreign operative inside of him furious. As he came out of the barn Holland came to a full stop again puzzled by the sheriff&rsquo;s actions. The sheriff had pulled his truck around to the side of the barn away from the main road. He was now leaning in through the driver-side window and retrieving a thermos. Holland walked around the corner of the barn to join him standing near the bumper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like a cup of coffee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; The sheriff leaned back in through the window and pulled out a second green plastic travel mug. He placed both cups on the hood and poured two cups of coffee.</p>
<p>The sheriff took one of the cups and slurped half of its contents in one go. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m assuming the letter was your idea?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holland took the other mug and began sipping. He turned in place, scanning the clearing around the barn and the woods beyond it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was,&rdquo; he answered still looking away. &quot; Is he out there right now watching us?&rdquo; It was the sheriff&rsquo;s turn to look startled. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s cut to the chase, shall we? I need to talk to him, to Nick. I don&rsquo;t want to hold the Avery&rsquo;s any longer than I have to.&rdquo; He reached into his jacket opening it so that the sheriff could see his rig. He pulled the pistol from its holster and set it down on the hood next to the thermos before taking a step back. &ldquo;Tell Nick to come down here. You have my gun,&rdquo; he held his jacket out and turned in a circle before facing the sheriff again. &ldquo;I have nothing else on me. And you have my word that no matter what happens right now that I will not try to apprehend Nick today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They looked at each other, neither one saying anything while they drank the coffee. The sheriff took one last swallow and then set the cup down next to Holland’s gun. He took the pistol and tossed it into the back of the Bronco. “Okay,” he said and took a few long strides past toward the wooded edge of the property. He waved his arm in a ‘come here’ gesture several times and then returned to the truck. Smith poured another cup from the thermos and asked, “was it the parking spot or something else?”</p>
<p>Holland looked at the other man studying what he saw there. All of the man’s abrasiveness seemed absent now, he looked calm, almost peaceful. “Not just that. I wasn’t lying about the CIA, you had all the earmarks of an informant in your body language. Mostly it was your unwillingness to enter the barn added to the spot you chose here. What about you, when did you change your mind about me?”</p>
<p>The sheriff’s eyes darted to Hollands right and he made the smallest of nods in that direction. “Talking to him,” he said as Nick stepped into view from behind Holland. The young man looked different, more solid, more self-assured. They locked eyes and Holland felt disoriented, a chill spreading down his arms.</p>
<p>That’s my trick, he thought as he wrestled with the impulse to look away. “Nick, good to see you again.”</p>
<p>“I wish I could say the same thing, Carter.” There was a wistful expression to the way he was looking at him that lent sincerity to the statement. Holland found himself saddened by the reproach even as he welcomed the use of his first name from the young man. The episode lasted only seconds but left Holland&rsquo;s mind racing.</p>
<p>The pieces were fitting together now, the two of them had come to an agreement about him. In the field you would work an asset, sometimes for months or years, hoping to get them to trust you. These two seemed to have done the work for him. It was an odd feeling and combined with recent events, it added to his sense of being off-balance.</p>
<p>“So how do I get my grandfather back home?” Nick still hadn’t broken eye contact. His stare was reminiscent of any number of child warfighters Holland had met. Each with a weariness that clashed in harsh contrast with their apparent ages.</p>
<p>“Mr. and Mrs. Avery will be returned unharmed so long as you cooperate Nick.”</p>
<p>Nick&rsquo;s stare did not falter as he responded in a soft flat tone, “don’t make threats you don’t want to keep. It undermines your position.” He leaned into the sheriff’s truck with a lopsided smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You both seem to have me pretty well figured out. But it&rsquo;s not me that you have to worry about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sheriff Smith asserted himself, &ldquo;Who do we need to worry about Holland? Not five minutes ago you were telling me that you really do work for the CIA. Enough with the innuendos, we have a truce of sorts lets put all our cards on the table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sheriff I can&rsquo;t put all my cards on the table. Even if I did I doubt you would believe me. Perhaps it would be better if Nick and I talked alone for a minute?&rdquo; The sheriff opened his mouth to respond but Nick held up a hand. They shared a look and then Nick shrugged his shoulders as if to say &ldquo;what the hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, but I&rsquo;m watching you the whole time.&rdquo; Holland watched the Sheriff gather up thermos and plastic cup and stomp the 20 yards or so to the barn entrance. He found a low bucket and rain barrel and sat to pour himself a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>Holland turned to Nick, &ldquo;how much does he know? For that matter how much does Avery know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told both Danny and CW about everything. To the best of my ability to explain that is.&rdquo; Nick stood up off of the truck and walked over to stand in front of Holland. &ldquo;I think there may be some confusion on your end though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your question seems to imply that I know something worth telling. The truth is that everything I know, Danny and I have pieced together with the help of CW. So it&rsquo;s not like I had a lot to tell them anyway. But let me take a shot in the dark at what you think is going on. I stumbled across something I wasn&rsquo;t supposed to see in the woods. We don&rsquo;t know what it is, but my grandfather says that it looked like a lump of charcoal. It was very smooth and symmetrical though and had a dull shine. You think I saw it or did something to it, how am I doing so far?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would say spot on. We need to know what you did to it and who else knows about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Danny is the only one who knows anything about it because he&rsquo;s the only one that saw it. I couldn&rsquo;t have done anything to it because I didn&rsquo;t see it. Yes, I was there, I&rsquo;m not arguing that point. I blacked out with some kind of episode. When I came to my head was pounding and I felt like I was dying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick let out a chuckle at this point and shook his head before continuing. &ldquo;Sorry, a little bit of an understatement there. Anyway, I was completely disoriented. When I managed to get my wits about me I got up and went straight back to my grandfather&rsquo;s cabin with the dogs. On, I forgot that part, the dogs were with me the whole time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused again waiting for some indication to continue, Holland gave a nod. Earlier, before I left Jeannie had lent me a pair of gloves and packed me lunch. In my disoriented state, I left those behind. So that&rsquo;s why Danny went back the next morning. He found the things I&rsquo;d left behind and whatever this thing is. He said it was like in the middle of a small symmetrical fire pit. The thing creeped him out when he got close to it. So instead of touching it, he buried it using the side of his boot. By the time you came around, it was two weeks later. Danny and I had only talked about it for the first time a few days before you showed up. I remember the day, it was Sunday, December 16. We watched the Detroit-Chicago game and talked a lot that night. We were going to go a look at the rock or whatever it is the next day, but there was a blizzard that night. I went the day after the blizzard, but the site had been freshly dug up. So now you know pretty much everything we know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holland stared at the young man, he had a sinking feeling, bubbling at the bottom of his gut. This was the worst-case scenario for the boy. If he didn&rsquo;t even remember interacting with the object there would be nothing to discover.</p>
<p>Chances are headquarters will want him tested and probed who knows what else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay for the sake of expediency I am willing to take all of that at face value. But none of it is going to help you, Nick. We know you were in the area on December 2. The fact that you lost consciousness only makes it more likely that you interacted with it. You must have activated this thing and we need to know how. The people that I work for will not stop until they know, Nick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holland took a deep breath, he couldn&rsquo;t look him in the eye so instead, he took a final pull from the little plastic cup. The coffee was cold and it didn&rsquo;t help his resolve. He looked back at Nick, &ldquo;do you understand what I&rsquo;m telling you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what Mr. Carter&hellip;, sorry Carter, I&rsquo;m not sure that I do. I&rsquo;m trying to read between the lines here. But there&rsquo;s a lot that I don&rsquo;t know. You seem to be implying…&rdquo; He turned to look over at the sheriff and then back to Holland. Nick straightened then walked around to the front of the truck to climb up the bumper to sit on the hood. &ldquo;I have a few more questions because this is all a little too surreal. Can you help me understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can try,&rdquo; he said with a sigh. A few fat drops of rain splattered on the hood next to them with an audible tap, tap, tap. A moment later the tapping accelerated into a constant roll. Already wet, Holland looked up at Nick, &ldquo;maybe we should move this into the barn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holland pulled the black sedan through the gate surrounding the private ski lodge. The lodge was serving as the safe house where Danny and Jeannie Avery were being kept. Outside the sky was still making lighthearted attempts at being stormy. Large, dark, and voluminous clouds rolled the sky, but patches of blue here and there ruined the effect.</p>
<p>He waited for a moment as the pattering of drops lessened outside of the window. Taking the opportunity to steel and steady his nerves before entering. The ski lodge was a four-bedroom apartment with a detached kitchen and event center. The lodge was on the backside of Mount Ashland and belonged to one of the inner circle&rsquo;s shell companies.</p>
<p>The Avery&rsquo;s and their two dogs had been given run of the apartment. The event center and kitchen had become a mobile command center.</p>
<p>Inside the kitchen, the smells of cooking filled the air. A full-time chef and three housekeepers came with the property. They were busy preparing the next meal. The pilot and two men from the task force were laughing and joking amongst themselves in the corner. They came to attention as Holland made his way into the kitchen, &ldquo;where&rsquo;s agent Pera?&rdquo; The captain gave him a serious nod and pointed toward the event center. Holland waived an acknowledgment and continued on, leaving them to their levity.</p>
<p>Sonny sat with a member of the task force and the analysts that had come with the group from California. He looked up as Holland entered the room. &ldquo;Did it work?&rdquo; There was a slight curl to his lip and the tone of voice oozed accusation. Holland guessed he had been talking about the very subject and not in a favorable manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It worked,&rdquo; he offered in response moving to sit down at the table with the three. The event center was a decade overdue for remodeling. Burnt orange shag carpet covered the entire floor. The walls were a warm yellow paneled wood. All the furniture in the room was glossy white. Bright colored throw pillows or tablecloths finished off the look. The entire scene resembled the set of a 1960s ski movie and it made Holland&rsquo;s anxiety worse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sheriff is in regular contact with Nicholas Starr. He doesn&rsquo;t know how to reach him, but he is working on figuring that out. He thinks that location might be either Los Angeles or Las Vegas. The sheriff also gave me a full account of what he thinks the Avery&rsquo;s know. For at least as much as they&rsquo;ve shared with him. I&rsquo;ve written down the account in my notes would like to compare it to what we have from both of the Averys. If necessary we can ask them about the new information directly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sonny was eyeing him through narrowed lids. &ldquo;After all that the sheriff just flipped on the kid no problems? No offense Holland, but he didn&rsquo;t seem to like you much last time. What made him change his mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The note that you were too lazy to read.&rdquo; As soon as he said it he knew that he had pushed the other man too far. He would need to smooth it over, but Pera had him feeling snappish. The constant condescension on top of the buildup of emotional pressure was too much. The plan that he and Nick could come up with relied a little more on Nick&rsquo;s word than Holland was comfortable with. If headquarters refused to release the Avery&rsquo;s, he would have no way to make Nick follow through.</p>
<p>Sonny&rsquo;s face turning redder by the second. Holland could tell that he was about to say something and spoke first to head him off, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean that, Sorry. It&rsquo;s been a long day and you&rsquo;re right, sheriff Smith and I don&rsquo;t see eye to eye and that made the day even longer. I shouldn&rsquo;t be taking it out on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sonny&rsquo;s hands were still shaking but his face receded from red to pink and then back to its normal dusky tan. Holland continued, &ldquo;when I told Avery to write the note I was pretty sure that he knew where he was. He put in a secret message to the sheriff and I let him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did what? The analyst asked inserting herself into the conversation. Holland looked at the young woman trying to remember if he had ever met her before this trip. Her name was Delgado, something Delgado. He could not remember her first name. He did remember this was her first field assignment as support. Something else, she had distinguished herself well behind a desk. He didn&rsquo;t see any harm in backing up for her and doing so would have the benefit of allowing Sonny to cool down further.</p>
<p>He turned to face Delgado. &ldquo;I did my best to put Danny Avery at ease during the interview. As I told him we were going to take him into custody I asked him to write a message to the sheriff. It&rsquo;s a body language and interaction technique. You might say I implanted the idea for him to put a hidden message in the letter. He did and it told the sheriff to find the barn. I knew it was there and I wanted him to put it there. You see Delgado, agent Pera is correct on one hand that sheriff Smith and I didn&rsquo;t get along but Smith&rsquo;s no dummy. He saw the hidden message and he knew I would&rsquo;ve seen it too. When he showed up at the barn I was there waiting and we had a good heart-to-heart as you might say. The fact that I let Danny write the message served as a kind of sign of my goodwill. You with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Delgado gave him an appraising look and a smile. She pulled out a notebook and began writing. She mumbled something like &ldquo;mm-hmm okay, thanks,&rdquo; half under her breath.</p>
<p>Sonny still looked skeptical. &ldquo;And he&rsquo;s going to give you Nick&rsquo;s location without anything from us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, on that you are right on point Pera. He wouldn&rsquo;t agree to that. What he did agree to was to try to get Nick&rsquo;s location and then tell us. He wants us to release the Avery&rsquo;s beforehand. When he sees that they&rsquo;re back at home or if we release them to him, he will give us the location.&rdquo;</p>
<p>“&ldquo;That hardly seems appropriate to away that much leverage. Are you planning on going through with that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All three pairs of eyes turned to Holland. He knew that how this next part played out would determine everything. &ldquo;Only if we have to. At this point, it looks like we&rsquo;ve been had. First, we nabbed Avery by mistake when he was wearing Nick&rsquo;s jacket. The same jacket the Smith&rsquo;s 19-year-old nephew wore all day. It not hard to understand how our informants were fooled by that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pulled out a picture of a tall lanky teen with dark hair. It had been a nice touch and a testament to the loyalty that Nick seemed to create. &ldquo;According to Smith he and Avery were trying to draw us out on purpose. They wanted to find out more about us. Last we were here we didn&rsquo;t do a very good job with our backstory. That is a problem I have rectified. &quot;</p>
<p>He stood up and pulled over a wheeled chalkboard. &ldquo;Now we have Nicholas Starr either in Los Angeles or Las Vegas.&rdquo; He drew two circles writing the city names over each. He is probably operating under an alias. We have Danny Avery with an extensive number of known contacts in the Los Angeles area.&rdquo; He scrawled the word AVERY inside the left circle. &quot; We have Smith with contacts all through Nevada,&rdquo; he repeated the all-caps SMITH in the right circle. &ldquo;Additionally, I think we should be checking into Ali Kalama. He has already demonstrated that he is more than willing to cover for the boy and has contacts in both cities. &quot;</p>
<p>Holland placed the third name in between the two cities in a box. He looked over at Delgado who was busy scribbling in her book, he waited until she caught up. &ldquo;Starr is 14, he may look like he&rsquo;s older but he&rsquo;s 14. He is not operating without a safety net. We have little chance of finding him on description alone but&hellip;&rdquo; He moved back to the drawing. &ldquo;The kid stands out enough that if any of these,&rdquo; he tapped the chalkboard three times. &ldquo;Potential leads are harboring him we should be able to pick him out in short order. So let&rsquo;s find him and let&rsquo;s do it before the sheriff gets back to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holland moved back to the table to look down at the group. &ldquo;In the meantime let&rsquo;s work the Avery&rsquo;s over again. Mix in the new information,&rdquo; Holland pulled out his notebook from his breast pocket. He flipped to the cloth bookmark and open the book and then pushed it over to her. &ldquo;Delgado here are my notes from the sheriff&rsquo;s conversation. Everything he told me the Avery&rsquo;s conveyed to him are here. Can you get busy working up some questions that should expose any discrepancies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stared at him for a moment wide-eyed before nodding her head to her three times with vigor, &ldquo;right away.&rdquo; Holland found her enthusiasm endearing and couldn&rsquo;t suppress a smile as he continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smith says that Starr checks in on Wednesdays and Saturdays. So let&rsquo;s get moving people if we beat him to the punch we hold all the cards.&rdquo;</p>
