<h1>Chapter 32</h1>

<br><br>
<p>“I  only need two that have been initiated to take the stone from him, and I  have Dr. Farouk here already, gentlemen,” the voice was muffled,  distorted, and yet still carried, echoing through the stairwell. Nick  guessed what Randall was driving at and broke from the safety of his  corner to crash down the stairs. Randall was still yelling into the PA  system. Nick ignored him to concentrate on not tripping.</p>
<p>Bang!  The gunshot made Nick flinch, missing a step. The ting-ting-clap of the  ricochet delayed his recovery, and he slid hard into the landing,  falling to one hand as he bounced off. The stolen pistol clattered to  the ground, sliding off the landing to fall to the floor below. He  pushed himself up and threw his body forward to continue.</p>
<p>Bang!  Nick’s head snapped up to the doorway below, where a body lay with its  legs splayed inside the stairwell. The torso held the door ajar over a  pool of blood. Nick’s legs stopped working as the rest of Holland came  into view. He bounced, stiff-legged, on his heel down the last four  stairs.</p>
<p>The brown skin of Holland’s forehead glistened with  sweat over a gaping red hole in place of his nose should have been. The  resulting visage was oddly skull-like. Someone was speaking to him, but  he couldn’t focus. Nick was getting good at dying. It almost didn’t  bother him anymore. This wasn’t even the first time Holland died before  him, but it was the first time he’d ever seen a friend murdered.</p>
<p>“Don’t  fucking move, I will shoot you in the leg, Nick!” Sonny’s words finally  registered. There was blood splattered over his forearm, with a few  specks showing dark on his white button-up. Further down, more blood  droplets covered the khaki slacks at the shin.</p>
<p>“You?!” Nick accused, his voice rising.</p>
<p>“Don’t move,” Sonny turned to yell toward the door. “Holland is down! I have Nick covered here, but I need backup. Now!”</p>
<p>“You  fucking dirtbag! Dammit!” Nick yell, then adjusted his tone to an  intimate and low bass. “Just when I thought there was hope for you,  Sonny.” Nick raised his hands, palm out, and lowered his voice to a  whisper. “I’m sorry about you and Aimee,” Nick said, letting the hurt of  Holland’s death mist his eyes.</p>
<p>“Hmm?” Sonny’s head cocked in confusion.</p>
<p>“Aimee  will never forgive this.” He waived down at Holland. “It’s over, at  least you saved her, it’s just too bad you can’t be together now,” Nick  pressed.</p>
<p>Fresh tears joined the streaks already on Sonny’s cheeks.  He blinked them back. Nick exploded, clearing Holland’s body in a  single, leaping stride. Sonny’s eyes shot open, and the gun moved toward  his moving target. He didn’t have a chance, Nick was in full combat  mode now. Watching the gun move as if in slow motion, Nick had time to  reflect on whether the relic enhanced or even caused his near  preternatural sense of time when pressed.</p>
<p>It had happened many  times, even before he had died for the first time before he ever even  remembered finding the relic. Did he take it with him that first time?  He still couldn’t remember for sure. Sonny’s right wrist would be in  range in, three, two, one. He reached out, closing his left hand around  the bones and jerking the arm into full extension. As he watched Sonny’s  weight shift with the pull, Nick his right fist deep into the space  behind Sonny’s ear where the jaw connected.</p>
<p>The cartilage popped,  and the jaw dislocated, Sonny’s knees buckled. Nick kept his right arm  moving, slamming the nape of the neck with his elbow and then reaching  over to grasp the pistol over the slide. Sonny fell, releasing the gun,  and time resumed its normal pace. Nick’s chest heaved, and he took a  moment to orient.</p>
<p>Behind  him, stomping, chunk-thump, chunk-thump  poured down the stairs. To his right, the floodlight flashed back on,  bathing the hall in the shadows of six or seven men rushing the man  door. Behind them, Randall called out, a hint of panic tinging his  message. “I need him alive! Alive!! Non-lethal force only! Someone tell  me what’s going on in there. Sonny! Sonny!”</p>
<p>With  a practiced spin on the balls of his feet, Nick bent down to snatch Holland’s pistol before sprinting to the kitchens.</p>
<p>What the hell was Randall saying a moment ago. He only needs two of them to take the relic? Was that possible?</p>
<p>Nick  shouldered through the double doors and slid to a stop and looked  behind at the hallway. Three men moved down the right side, trailing  bloody footprint, guns ready. Five more slid under the roll-up door, one  after the other. Nick laughed. Randall had hamstrung them.</p>
<p>With  one  hand, he tucked Holland’s gun into the belt at his back. With the  other, he sighted the closer group on the right. Only aiming at their  hips and groins above thigh plates but below the body armor, he began  firing.</p>
<p>Pop-pop, one down. Pop-pop, two down. The third man threw  himself into the wall, sliding up to a row of lockers. Nick moved the  gun left, pop-pop. Another went down, the two in the rear aborted their  entrance and retreated onto the dock. Pop-pop, another. The last man  standing in the hall sprayed bullets from his compact submachine gun.</p>
<p>Nick  ducked back around the doorway leading into the kitchens and checked  the mag on Sonny’s gun. Three bullets remained in the clip. He slammed  it back into place and reached into his front pocket to pull the relic  out, lifting it in front of him. The arcs spread out like fountains. He  touched the very end of the brightest line of blue.</p>
<p>Gently rolling  back the scene, Nick examined the shooter’s foot for placement and  location. He scrolled forward, watching the angles he moved through,  noticing, as he did, the man behind the lockers stepping out into the  hall. Nick stopped the scene with the locker man at the very edge of his  vision. Poised like a sprinter, he had dropped his gun.</p>
<p>Nick  lowered the stone and lifted the gun toward the open door, firing  without looking, pop-pop-pop. There hadn’t been time to aim, but at  least one shot hit the thundering freight train of body armor. Nick  heard the man grunt just as he crashed into him. He let the gun go,  trying to turn as they hurtled toward a stainless-steel table in the  shadowy room behind him.</p>
<p>Nick tucked, lifting his feet up to catch  the edge of the table and bending his wrist and elbow to pump the last  bullet into his assailant. It almost worked. The man stumbled. Nick’s  feet caught the table, slowing them for a heartbeat. Nick pushed back on  the table. The slip-on canvas boat shoes refused the concept of  traction on the dusty steel. One foot slipped over the table, the other  down. Nick’s thigh and groin slammed into the beveled steel edge of the  steel and everything flashed white in pain.</p>
<p>Head swimming and eyes  watering, Nick forced his jaw to unclench and gulped air. The hands  that held him down felt awkward, almost weak. Nick slid his hands down  one arm, taking several fingers in a two-handed grip, wrenching them  back and apart. The scream in his ear made him cringe. He pulled harder,  forcing the now twisted finger even further apart and twisting. The  bones popped and crunched; the arms slackening.</p>
<p>Nick erupted,  bench-pressing the arms away and twisting his hips to the side. The  table’s lower shelf banged painfully against his shin underneath, but he  shimmied his thigh on top to the edge and over. With both feet on the  ground, Nick reached behind, fumbling at his waistband. Holland’s gun  hadn’t come loose during the scuffle. It caught in his belt as he tried  to pull it free. He was still tugging and twisting when Mr. Submachine  Gun rounded the corner.</p>
<p>The doorway exploded in noise and light.  Nick ducked behind the cowering figure in body armor. The shooter didn’t  care for Randall’s orders, or for anyone’s life but his own. The  crack-chip-splat of bullets hitting armor, tile and flesh repeated  several times over. Nick pulled his now bleeding assailant by the collar  toward the back of the room, aiming for the grill.</p>
<p>The noise  stopped, replaced with the clickity-clackity sounds of the slide being  abused. Nick let go of his human shield, watching it crumble wetly. With  a final jiggle, the gun came free, Nick spread his feet and turned his  body into the sight. He had never been a marksman, but he could shoot  well enough when he tried. Feet firm, he sighted with care and squeezed  only once. The bullet struck just under a cheek; his head turning with  the impact.</p>
<p>Nick had the momentary impression that Mr. Submachine  Gun was looking for someone behind him, before he tipped, stiffed  legged to fall like a board to the ground. As the echoes of the last  shot faded, everything settled into deep silence. He could hear his  heartbeat and the ragged sound of his breathing. Nick looked down at the  macerated body below him, and his stomach flipped twice.</p>
<p>“Fu ooh  oooh ck,” Nick swore around a sudden stream of vomit. He wiped his  mouth, looking at the ceiling and breathing intentionally. In, one, two,  three, hold one, two, three, four…</p>
<p>Feeling unburdened, lighter,  Nick stared down at the gun. This was the end of this timeline. It was  over. There’s nothing left to learn, he mused, turning the gun to rest  the barrel on his temple.</p>
<p>Just squeeze the trigger, you coward.  Every minute we wait risks Randall getting his way. But would that  really be so bad? Yeah, it would. Wait.</p>
<p>Nick lowered the gun and  walked out into the main hall to the loading dock. Streaks of blood  trailed from half a dozen spots, all leading to the door. Not a single  body remained in the area. He walked on, avoiding the grizzly paths of  red.</p>
<p>“Randall!” He bellowed from just inside the door. “Randall, you still out there, or did you have a heart attack, old man?”</p>
<p>“Nicholas Starr,” the comic book voice replied immediately. “Come out. We need to talk. I won’t hurt you.”</p>
<p>“I’m  fine where I am, thanks. We can talk like this.” He lowered himself to  sit behind the roll-up track against the wall. “What did you mean when  you said you could take the stone?”</p>
<p>“I have a secret about  transferring control that Gabriel didn’t write into the journal.”  Silence reverberated. Randall continued. “It’s a burden, isn’t it, Nick?  You realize, it can be over now. Sonny is still alive. He is receiving  medical attention right now.”</p>
<p>“How does it work,” Nick yelled back. “I want you to tell me the details before I agree to anything.”</p>
<p>“Fine, can I come in there to talk face to face? I am unarmed, no one else will bother us and we can talk privately.”</p>
<p>He  didn’t trust Randall Pera, but then again he didn’t know him either. “I  don’t see why not, but I’m keeping a gun on you. Your age won’t lull me  into a false sense of security. Try anything foolish and I will shoot  you.”</p>
<p>To Nick’s surprise, Randall chortled, “fair enough. Let’s  say I’m flattered, even.” The PA squelched as it turned off. Muffled  orders floated to his ears, and he could hear people running back and  forth nearby. He assumed a waiting position, aiming at the gap under the  door.</p>
<p>Three sets of legs approached the opening in a tight group.  Nick tensed, ready for anything. “Toss the chair under the door and  leave. I can take it from here,” Randall said to his companions,  sounding much younger in person. Two folding chairs, one on top of the  other, appeared, sliding through to a stop a few feet inside the  corridor.</p>
<p>A moment later, Randall ducked under the door, aided by a  cane, and stepped in. He blinked at the shadows for a moment before  bending down to pick up a chair. When he finished unfolding and setting  the chair on the ground, he turned to Nick. “Hello, Mr. Starr.” He  kicked the remaining chair toward Nick before sitting down.</p>
<p>“I am  Randall Pera, the Chairman of the OFF, it’s good to finally meet in  person. Although I must admit, we’ve been watching you so long on CCTV  that I feel I’ve met you already.”</p>
<p>Mildly creepy, but I guess we expected no less, Nick mussed. “So what’s this secret?”</p>
<p>“Cut  to the chase, is it? Very well, I never had much patience for banter  myself.” Randall adjusted his thick frame to lean forward, placing his  hands together at the top of his cane and resting his chin there.  “Gabriel Shaw intended for the Relic to stay in my family Nicholas. He  believed he had learned how to rid himself of its curse but didn’t want  the method of transfer widely known.”</p>
<p>“That makes sense, but he  failed to hand it off. The fact that I found it userless, means that  either someone else failed as well or there is a way to abandon it. What  makes you sure you know how to take it?”</p>
<p>“Hmm, honestly, I hadn’t  thought of it in that way, but your question remains. Shaw had two  nephews, Charles and Samuel Pera, my great-great-grandfather and  granduncle, respectively. What Shaw didn’t realize was that Samuel was  jealous of his older brother and sabotaged the ceremony to prevent  Charles from inheriting the stone.”</p>
<p>Randall paused, and Nick jumped in. “you said you only need two people, but in the journal, Shaw made preparations for a dozen.”</p>
<p>“I  also said he didn’t want anyone to know how it really worked. He only  told Charles. Charles was my grandfather Walter’s grandfather. I  inherited the journal and this story from Walter Pera. My grandfather  and I were close. He taught me everything he learned about the relic,  about its purpose, and about Gabriel Shaw.”</p>
<p>This was different.  Nick wasn’t sure what he expected, but it had been storytime. He studied  the old man as he talked. Randall Pera looked better at 85 than  Nicholas remembered feeling and 65. His blue eyes were clear and sharp  and there was a solidness visible everywhere underneath the loose and  thinning skin. It was cunning and desperation in that icy stare.</p>
<p>Nick  allowed himself to rest the gun on his thigh and leaned back in the  chair while he continued to listen to Randall speak. The change in his  posture noted with a pause, Randall’s eyes flicked to the gun and then  back with a hint of acknowledgment.</p>
<p>“Let me cut to the chase,  Nicholas. Charles had information that wasn’t in the Journal, but his  brother Samuel had been sneaking to read the journal when no one was  around. He had figured out enough about how things worked to believe he  could take Charles’s place in the ritual. And according to my  grandfather, even though there were several years between the two young  men, they looked much like. Several days before the ritual, Samuel paid  some local thugs to give his brother up beating. Gabriel wanted to  postpone the ritual but recognized he was dying and Charles insisted he  could manage. Charles never made it to the ritual. His doting brother  must’ve drugged him while attending to his bedside and then taken his  place. By the time he recovered enough to get out of bed, Gabriel Shaw  was dead and the ritual had taken place.”</p>
<p>“And Gabriel had never initiated Samuel,” Nick guessed.</p>
<p>“That’s  correct. Samuel was repentant, but the damage was done. The brotherly  on the broken justice cleanly as possession of the relic, which had gone  missing when Shaw died. He tried to make amends, of course. Samuel  spent his whole life searching for the relic. Never married, he chased  rumors to the ends of the earth. Samuel was dead before his 40th  birthday. Years later, when his brother passed the journal on, he used  Samuel’s life as a lesson. And when my grandfather passed the journal to  me, he did as well. You see, my family has been searching for that rock  for over one hundred and fifty years, Nicholas. Each generation  learning the story of how it drove Samuel to ruin even as they learned  how it made Gabriel Shaw the legend of a man that he was.” He paused  again, staring out at the loading dock.</p>
<p>“You know I had it once,”  Randall continued. “I had the relic in my hand and the man who possessed  it in my custody. I lost them both, a mistake I will not make again  Nicholas.”</p>
<p>Nick withdrew the relic from his pocket and held it up  between his fingers and thumb like he was showing off an Apple. “You  know what this does Randall?”</p>
<p>“Of course I do. I’ve read the  journal hundreds of times. Plus, it belongs in my family.” Nick could  tell he had hit a nerve with the question. He pressed further.</p>
<p>“No,  I’ve read the journal. It describes specific effects and some of the  mechanics of using it. But nowhere in that journal does Gabriel ever  reveal what it does. Randall, what do you think you will achieve through  control of this rock?”</p>
<p>Randall’s broad, grey, stubbled jaw worked  up and down, but he said nothing. Nick threw him the stone, a move that  took Randall so much by surprise that he nearly fell out of his chair  trying to catch it. He held it in his hands, head down for a long  moment. In the dim light, Nick couldn’t be sure if Randall was crying or  not. But his voice was clear and hard when he finally spoke. “I’ve put  together quite a bit, Mr. Starr. You must know we’ve been listening to  the lab this entire time. This rock.” he shook the relic palm up like a  weapon. “It lets you control time. Or, as you have been using the  phrase, timelines. It lets you recall your memories, store extra  knowledge and pass knowledge and memories onto other people. With this  in my resources, I can reshape the world. Make it a better place.” He  drifted off, staring into the blackness under his fingers.</p>
<p>“That’s  closer than I expected, but still quite a way off from reality.  Randall, if you were to take this relic from me today and claim it as  your own, you would be anchored here.” Nick made a small show of rolling  over his left wrist and reading the time. “That means, assuming you  could get it done in the next half-hour, your new birthday would be 1:30  in the morning of July 24, 1985. Until you handed off the relic to your  successor, you would return to that moment every time you died. Every  time you would start over from right there. Only you would remember  unless you initiate other people and remember to re-initiate them every  time. It’s hard to get things right, especially big things Randall.”</p>
<p>He  was lecturing Randall like a child now, like one of his own children.  His sense of indignation overriding his anger. He had to make Randall  understand his expectations would not meet reality. He had to see that  realization in those blue eyes, even for just a moment, before he took  it all away. Part of him wondered if this showed some loss of humanity,  some growing sadism.</p>
<p>“It’s very hard, actually. The bigger the  thing you want to accomplish Randall, the more times you will have to  put in identical work for years only to fail, die and start at the  beginning again. You’re going to turn 86 next month, aren’t you? How  much time do you really have left, old man? What will you do if you keep  dying before you get done what you want to do?” He was on the edge of  shouting now.</p>
<p>“No!” Randall yelled, “that’s not how it works!” But his wide eyes, full of panic, told a different story.</p>
<p>Nick  rose from the chair. “Yes, it is Randall. That’s exactly how it works.  Think about it. How could a teenage boy do the things I’ve done?  Outsmart, outmaneuver and subvert a senior CIA operative. Convert your  lead scientist, even your own grandson. How could I do those things? I  can do those things, Randall, because I’ve failed in trying more times  than you can imagine. I&rsquo;ve watched your family&rsquo;s avarice and lust for power ruin everything over and over again.&quot; Nick stepped closer. He could see the tears running down Randall&rsquo;s face now. &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t have to worry about any of it, Randall, do you know why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Red-rimmed eyes met his. Randall looked 30 years older than he had a moment ago. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he croaked.</p>
<p>Nick smiled down, shifting his weight onto his left foot as his right foot snapped out. 85-year-old bones snapped, and the relic flew out the open door, sliding across the loading dock and falling over the edge. &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; Nick stepped back. &ldquo;I will never.&rdquo; He lifted the gun. &ldquo;Let you.&rdquo; Now pressing the barrel snugly against his skull, mentally checking the angle. &ldquo;Have it!&rdquo; He pulled the trigger.</p>
