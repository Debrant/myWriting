<h1>Chapter 15</h1>

<br><br>
<p>Nick watched the side-view mirror of the motorcycle as the hotels of Las Vegas shrank. It was still too cold to drive at night which meant he was making his trip back to Medford in a single 10-hour drive. The sun was low on the horizon, having only been out for an hour. That was long enough to warm the air and chase away the overnight frost.</p>
<p>US Highway 95 stretched out in front of him razor straight. It went on and on to meet the bright blue winter sky. Desert browns and yellows ran out from the bright concrete to either side of the highway. Low-slung mountain framed the desert in either direction. A wide and shallow valley with two bone-white rivers of cement at the center. Here in 1985, the highway was all but flawless and a dream to ride.</p>
<p>He could feel the morning air tugging at the gaps between his leathers. It yanked at the looser parts of his clothing. This was his second trip from Las Vegas to Medford by way of Reno. He had given the ride a nickname, &ldquo;God&rsquo;s Highway.&rdquo; It made him chuckle and smile every time he thought it. He had always enjoyed double entendres.</p>
<p>Nick shuddered with joy despite himself as he pulled the throttle back with his right hand. The SuperSport lept forward between his legs, pulling in his guts. The speedometer rolled past 100 miles an hour and the trucks in the right lane flying by might as be statues. The shutter became a giggle. To see everything for 10 miles around, to have the reflexes, the control, and the stamina. It was a dream and it was one of the few things he could do that never felt boring.</p>
<p>Nick reflected over the week&rsquo;s work as he drove on. He had arrived in Vegas on the previous Friday. His first action had been to find an apartment. A brightly lit studio apartment in the Five Points neighborhood was the first to fit the bill. He was certain that the $295 a month was too much by the 1985 going rate. He had not been able to bring himself to haggle over it. The manager had offered him a single $150 deposit plus the first month&rsquo;s rent to move in on the spot. By midday, on Saturday he had managed to find a foldout couch, a dinette set, and lamps at a local thrift store. He had thrown up a few posters picked up from the corner store and the place had already started to feel like home.</p>
<p>That first evening as Nick had eaten a simple grilled sandwich in his corner that served as a kitchen. The act had felt like a milestone. Much like the feeling of being on a motorcycle, it had been visceral. It carried a sense of release from captivity. A sense that the world opening it up for him, again. After dinner he had counted $1535.76, every penny he had left, and then made his way to the Dunes Casino.</p>
<p>There was something unquestioningly seedy about the place, but in a way that made him feel home. The dunes had been long gone by the time Nick visited Las Vegas as an adult the first time around. Strangely though its iconic signage had always been part of his mental image when he thought of the city.</p>
<p>Inside at the noisy flickering bar, he had no trouble finding a cadre of old-timers willing to show him the ropes. He had settled on a friendly old shark in his mid-70s embroiled in an argument with his friend. Nick listened to their banter for a time before joining the table. Their talk spanned the forthcoming Super Bowl and the recently passed presidential election. Nick spent $13, with a tip, on ordering two pictures of beers after sitting down. An entire hour had was lost as they argued about who was even qualified to teach the young blood and who wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>After some time Isadore, Isa to his friends, and Nick had settled into a friendly conversation. Isa had remarked that his nephew, a respectable psychologist, the state hospital outside of Portland. They talked about the Pacific Northwest for a while and traveling. After a time Nick had worked in his desire to know more about sports betting. An embarrassingly long amount of time was spent trying to get him to understand Vegas' odds. Isa explained standard sports betting and why betting on the winner was often not the best bet. In fact, it didn&rsquo;t offer you very much in the way of payout if the favorite was the winner you bet on.</p>
<p>Isa had explained over under betting to him. They had used the Super Bowl the next day as an example. &ldquo;By betting $110 on the over, let&rsquo;s say, then if you won you would receive $210 back. But if you wanted to win the same $100 betting on San Francisco. Well, they&rsquo;re favored to win by a spread of 3.5, so you would need to spend $160 to win that same $100. You got it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Nick had enjoyed his occasional trips to Vegas throughout his life. Preferring to play cards, craps, and other games out on the floor, he had never gambled on sports. The entire lesson had left his head hurting and not much more confident than when he&rsquo;d begun. In reflection, it could have been the beer that had left his head hurting. His 14-year-old metabolism didn&rsquo;t appreciate his 70-year-old thirst.</p>
<p>He drank more beers than he had intended to in the process of working up the nerve to place a bet. He had wrestled with his impulse to bet the over for more than an hour before placing it. He remembered that San Francisco would win but not by how much. In his tipsy artificial bravery, he&rsquo;d bet all his money on the over.</p>
<p>It spent all Sunday morning pacing and second-guessing his decision. So many Super Bowls had been blowouts. The over-under was 53.5 points and all he could remember was that San Francisco would score 30-ish. The night before he had reasoned that with a spread of 3.5 the teams should both score close to 30. That was of little comfort for most of Sunday. He had no appetite and checked his watch every 15 minutes to see if it was game time.</p>
<p>The start of the game found him sitting back at the grainy wooden bar. Surrounded by the noise of slot machines in the distance eyes glued to the television. Slow to start, the San Francisco 49ers destroyed the Miami Dolphins in the second half. At halftime, the two teams had racked up 44 points Nick had begun to relax. Only 10 points for the rest of the game. Nick became aware of exactly how close he&rsquo;d come to losing everything. He felt sick and even as the cashier counted out $ 2,720.45 back he couldn&rsquo;t shake it.</p>
<p>The episode had left him questioning his entire plan to make money in this way. Fake ID or not, there had been plenty of paperwork to verify for the payout. Vegas of the 1980s was not the glitzy high-powered billion-dollar machine that it was of his day. It was sad around the edges, it was struggling. It was hard-eyed and hungry. He had the feeling that winning too often would raise the wrong kind of attention.</p>
<p>He met up again with his new friend Isa on Monday. They&rsquo;d played some blackjack together and Isa &ldquo;taught Nick&rdquo; about craps. It had been good to talk to someone with some common sense. They had played well and Nick had enough to open a checking account with $3000 holding back a little for the road.</p>
<p>The sign for Carson City pulled him back to the moment. Nick turned left onto US-50 as his stomach assailed him with the need for food. He let his reverie fade to plan the rest of the trip. Turing onto NV-439, he imagined the hearty Italian lunch he would order at Casale’s Halfway Club in Reno.</p>
<p>The air was warmer now and he considered the options ahead. If he made his way over to the I-5 after lunch he could enjoy the day, maybe even switch to the open-faced helmet. But that would leave him to finish the last leg of the trip in the dark. He would ask about the road conditions in Reno. The weather had been good in Vegas he hoped that was true further north as well. It would be cold to stay northbound but it was 100 miles shorter. Plus a 100 times more pretty to drive the 44 to the 89 through the Lassen National Forest than to cut across to the I-5.</p>
<p>Nick slowed as he came out of the little canyon looking for the gravel access road to Pilot Rock. In another 25 years, this area would be declared a national monument. For now, it was home to University researchers and hard-core hiking enthusiasts only. Pilot rock itself was a 500-foot jagged peak of volcanic rock visible for miles around. It was within hiking distance from the Pacific Coast Trail. Being right off Old Highway 99 made it popular with geology majors during the summer months.</p>
<p>It was not summer now. Occasional patches of snow hid in the shadier spots on the forest floor. The air was crisp and dry as he turned down the trail to the hunting cabin that CW had arranged for him. The pine forest here was rough and scraggly. Sparse pines left ample ground space between them. Tarweed, chaparral, and the occasional oak or ponderosa pine cluster grew in the gaps. The grasses ranged from greens to browns to yellows and back again. The trail ran several miles and was rough enough to discourage casual exploration. The room hunting cabin sat in a shadowy little valley at the end of the trail.</p>
<p>The sun was receding behind the mountains. The sky shot through with pink and lavender as Nick pulled the bike under a makeshift hunting blind. The light faded fast as he unpacked. He pulled a bull&rsquo;s-eye lantern off of its hook and fumbled along the shelf for the matches.</p>
<p>The hooded glow of the lantern cast a circle of yellow light around him as he made his way toward the cabin. The shadows of his legs and the aftereffects of 10 hours of wind and engine noise playing havoc with his senses. Inside he placed the lantern by the table and got busy lighting a fire in the wood-burning stove. In the morning he would head down to Callahan&rsquo;s Café where he would meet with CW. They would go about their business of covering for Nick&rsquo;s absence. For now, Nick was content to revel in the moment. His physical exhaustion and the feeling of accomplishment that came with it. The pleasure of spending an entire day exposed to the elements on the back of a motorcycle.</p>
<p>Nick put his left hand on the driver-side window bending over to look at CW seated behind the wheel. &ldquo;Thanks again for everything, we couldn&rsquo;t hope to pull this off without you. I haven&rsquo;t made up my mind yet whether I&rsquo;m going back in the morning. It&rsquo;s probably not safe to stay here with these guys flying around in helicopters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nick the pleasure is all mine. I have nothing against working with the feds but I can&rsquo;t get a straight answer out of these guys to save my life.&rdquo; He paused to spit into a paper cup. &ldquo;You and Danny are two of only a handful of people on this planet that I&rsquo;d stake my reputation on their word. Everything you said and showed me has proven true. You got my number, when you get a phone down there in Vegas you let me know. I don&rsquo;t think any judge would sign a wiretap order on a Sheriff&rsquo;s office. Or on a Sheriff&rsquo;s home for that matter. Something about these guys tells me they&rsquo;re not above doing any without authorization. So when you call do like we talked about. Call from a payphone, leave a message with anybody at the station if you can&rsquo;t get a hold of me. Tell him you have a message from Lyndon Johnson and you read those numbers backward by section. You got that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, thanks again, Sheriff.&rdquo; Nick stepped back from the window and watched him pull away and head back toward the highway. After a moment he turned toward Callahan&rsquo;s Café where he planned on ordering some food to take back to the cabin.</p>
<p>Nick opened his eyes in the darkness is mind alert to the sound of an engine approaching from the distance. His anxiety increased as the sound continue to draw closer. The engine turned off at what must be the end of the drivable trail that led to the cabin. He threw his clothes in a rush of motion, fumbling in the dark. His throat was tight and his pulse accelerated. Only the owner of the cabin and CW knew that Nick was staying here and CW had said he would only come in case of emergency. Nick slipped on his boots and pulled on his coat before cracking the door open.</p>
<p>He could hear the heavy crunching sound of someone approaching on foot. The sky above was a half shade lighter than pitch. Dawn would break soon, but it was still dark enough his visitor was using a flashlight. He slipped out of the doorway shifting his body weight up and into the door to keep it silent as it closed.</p>
<p>The flashlight bobbed down the trail less than a dozen yards away now. Nick ducked off to the rear of the cabin using his hands on the ground to keep from making noise on the way up the slope.</p>
<p>Nick circled back toward the front of the cabin for a view of the door. As he came around the figure approached the only door flashlight still shinning.</p>
<p>Knock knock knock! &ldquo;Nick, are you in there? It&rsquo;s CW, something&rsquo;s happened. I&rsquo;m coming in.&rdquo; The man was placing his hand on the door handle when Nick stood up and called down to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother Sheriff, I&rsquo;m over here.&rdquo; He scrambled back down to the cabin noting the solemn expression on the Sheriff&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>“It&rsquo;s Danny and Jeannie.&quot; He seemed to hesitate as if not knowing what to say before continuing, &ldquo;they took them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; Nick stopped in his tracks, &ldquo;you mean agent Carter took Danny and Jeannie? Are they under arrest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not under arrest. Just gone. After I dropped you off, Jeannie called me to say that Danny was an hour overdue and she was getting worried. He went out wearing the jacket that we dropped about two hours before she called. . Anyway, I told her to call me as soon as he got in. I didn&rsquo;t hear from her, so I went out to check on her before I went home for the night&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And?&rdquo; Nick asked as he pushed past the sheriff into the interior of the cabin. The sky was turning silver behind them as the first rays of dawn exposed the treetops against the skyline. The interior of the cabin was still dark and he relit the lantern while waiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she didn&rsquo;t get back to me. I went out there and neither one of them was at home. I looked around the property and let myself in. I found this,&rdquo; he handed Nick a torn off yellow legal pad page with Danny&rsquo;s artistic scrawl covering half of the page.</p>
<p>CW,</p>
<p>First, let me say how much we all appreciate the help and support you have given us over the recent weeks. If you&rsquo;re reading this you&rsquo;re probably a little confused. Now let me assure you everything is well. Don&rsquo;t know for how long, but Jeannie and I have decided to travel back to Portland for a little while.</p>
<p>Basically, Jane is beside herself what with Nick often working on his own and Jack leaving. Although she hasn&rsquo;t asked for our help I know she needs it. Right now I can&rsquo;t tell you how long we will stay, but we should be back within a couple of weeks. Now I need a favor, Jeanie has agreed to come only because I have promised her you would look after the horses.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Danny</p>
<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a lot to go on. Did you find anything else when you were looking around?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t, but there&rsquo;s more than you think right there in that letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick read the letter again and then a third time before seeing the simple hidden message. &ldquo;I have to assume this means something to you? Also, it seems a little off, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Off in what way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean this is pretty simple. You can barely call it a hidden message. Our guys must have read this letter, I mean there&rsquo;s no way they didn&rsquo;t. So either they don&rsquo;t care about what&rsquo;s in it or&rdquo;</p>
<p>CW turned around stopping his pacing eyes wide, &ldquo;or whoever read it wants us to find the clue!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right, you&rsquo;ve dealt with these guys before, do you think that&rsquo;s likely?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t much like either of them. But to be fair, I don&rsquo;t like being jerked around so that may have tainted my opinion. The younger guy might let something like this slide. The only problem with that is I didn&rsquo;t get the sense that he cared about anything other than himself. He&rsquo;s real friendly and all, but shifty. I could see him doing it to piss Holland off, but for that matter, I can&rsquo;t see Holland leaving it up to him. That guy stays in control.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you don&rsquo;t think it could have been Holland?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know Nick, as I said before, the guy&rsquo;s a hard ass. I&rsquo;m pretty sure he pisses by the book. Now that I say that out loud though&hellip; There&rsquo;s nothing by the book about nabbing civilians without a warrant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>CW seemed to be going somewhere so Nick threw him a, &ldquo;keep going.&rdquo; As he made his way over to the bed to roll up his bag and pack his things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, maybe it is him. You said you met him what was your impression?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Intelligent, personable, he&rsquo;s real easy to talk to. Even knowing now that he was watching and following me, I can&rsquo;t say that I picked up anything weird from him at all. Heck, if I had to guess, I would&rsquo;ve said that Carter Holland cares about what happens to me. Why? Other than being a hard-ass what did you get from him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. The truth is I let my emotions get the better of me. It really pisses me off to be played or bulldozed, he did both. But looking back, if I were to make a few assumptions&hellip; One, if he is a by the book. Then two, he may not agree with the orders handed down to him…&rdquo;</p>
<p>CW was pacing again which was no easy task in the small room. Two steps of his long-legged stride brought him to the stove and two more back to the door. &ldquo;It could be that he was putting me off on purpose, hoping that I would dig. If that were true and what you say is true then I would imagine this letter might&rsquo;ve even been his idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick shouldered his bag and moved to stand by the door next to CW. &ldquo;So where does that leave us big guy? Have you been to the barn already?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I figured there was little chance of finding anything in the dark. I went home to get some rest and prevent the missus from worrying. We have to decide whether we want to risk your being seen or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick pushed the door open and let himself out and then turned around on the little stoop. &ldquo;I say we risk it. The way I see it, Danny wouldn&rsquo;t have written it if he didn&rsquo;t think it was safe. We have too many questions about who these guys are and what they want. So how about this, let&rsquo;s get a map and you can show me where this barn is. I can figure out an alternate route to get there. I will sneak up to the edge of the property and wait for you to come on the main entry and we can see what will happen. If it looks clear I&rsquo;ll come out and join you. If not I will watch until it&rsquo;s not safe, at which point I will turn tail and meet you back at Callahan&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>CW came out of the doorway closing it behind him stepped down into the open air. Sunrise was in full swing now and bright enough to see Pilot Rock in the distance. CW was chuckling and shaking his head back and forth with a smile. &ldquo;Oh boy, I can&rsquo;t wait to see how this ends. This is the craziest damn piece of business I&rsquo;ve never been involved in as sheriff. You are by far the strangest 14-year-old I&rsquo;ve ever met. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know why, and it&rsquo;s not too late to back out,&rdquo; Nick offered. The sheriff followed him to the hunting blind where Nick began readying the bike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nick, don&rsquo;t get me wrong I&rsquo;d prefer this type of crazy any day. Other than my friends being kidnapped, I would take it over the day-to-day crazy I deal with as sheriff. &quot; Nick had the bike out and the blind covered back up. &ldquo;Alright enough talking, I&rsquo;ve a map in the truck and I already know how you can get in the back way.&rdquo; CW Smith put his hat back on and strode up the trailhead.</p>
