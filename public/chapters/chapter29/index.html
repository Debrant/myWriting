<h1>Chapter 29</h1>

<br><br>
<p>Holland watched Darren shake off the paramedic and stumble to the back of his car after the tow truck dropped back on flat ground. It had been hard not to finish the big man off as he lay sprawled and stunned in the road. If their situations had been reversed, he knew Horne wouldn’t hesitate to pull the trigger. When looking down at him helplessly in the road, Holland couldn’t bring himself to do it.</p>
<p>Darren had tried to kill him back once already and just showed that he wouldn’t hesitate to knock off anyone he had to. It was probably a mistake to leave him in play, but Holland had reached his share of killing years ago and felt a better man for it. Through the binoculars, he watched Darren strap on a ballistic vest and remove a compact rifle from the trunk before climbing into the car.</p>
<p>Nothing happened for several minutes, during which Holland could only guess that Darren was reporting in. It was impossible to make out any detail through the tinted windows of the black sedan car. Ten minutes passed before the car pulled away toward the main highway. This was his chance. If everything went right, he and Nick would be long gone before anyone even noticed. With just a little good luck, Jack would be on a plane back to Oregon within the hour, and then Aimee could focus on getting herself out from the middle of this mess. He didn’t have the time right now to worry about her, but she was smart as hell and didn’t need him treating her like some damsel in distress.</p>
<p>It still felt wrong to let Aimee and Farouk grieve him while he watched from the shadows. But the alternatives were all worse. With a shake of his head, all and returned up the steep path to his waiting car. He needed to contact Aimee without Sonny finding out. But the two were all that inseparable since she&rsquo;d returned.</p>
<p>Within minutes he pulled the car into a shaded section of the grass off the side of the service road, close to where Darren had found Amy&rsquo;s white rental. Every muscle and joint hurt with layers of exhaustion after a long week of the following agent horn.</p>
<p>His head still spun with the experience of staging his car for the ambush and watching it burn. The callousness with which Horne unloaded his entire clip into the car as it burned, hitting the slumped body multiple times as a burned.</p>
<p>That shadow memory of burning to death still scarred his inner peace and haunted his dreams. Then retracing his steps from New Orleans until the day of the ambush had added yet another layer to his trauma.</p>
<p>There had been times overseas, while deeply embedded in a cover identity, that had forced him to rely on years of training and experience alone to stay on track. During these times, he felt like a passenger in his own body. Watching, not participating.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Jean Saint Fiore, not Carter Holland. Only his training would carry him through. Eventually, it would be time for Holland to come forward in the disassociation would fade away as agent Carter took over and completed whatever mission he had been on.</p>
<p>Dying in the fire to be reborn in the lab triggered the same feelings of watching a stranger, only it was him, his life, and he was the stranger. Just like undercover work, he had a persona, knowledge, and objectives that didn&rsquo;t fit together naturally. He was privy to extra–situational knowledge. This felt worse.</p>
<p>The urge to change it all was powerful. He almost ruined everything several times when the disassociative malaise covered him beyond the point of recognizing his environment. Then all at once, the pretending ended and the hiding and chasing began. Darren Horne was proving to be more than a thorn in his side. The man had a talent for fieldwork, intuitively picking a high point with clear lines of sight all around for watching his targets.</p>
<p>Holland&rsquo;s only options for undetected navigation had him swinging wide circles around the hospital every time he went anywhere. Now on the way down the hill the midday sun poked through the foliage, shining like flashlight beams, were a pinhole diorama of the stars. In the moments when Holland crossed into one of those beams, he felt the temperature spike and welcomed the shade on the other side.</p>
<p>At the edge of the lot before the loading dock, he paused. In part to brace himself from the July heat, but mostly to steal his thoughts and calm his nerves. He was nervous to see Nick again. The leap of faith Holland had made in trusting Nick paled compared to the act of &ldquo;reliving a timeline.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s what Nick called it, anyway.</p>
<p>In the month since they had last spoken, the magnitude of what the man was going through had finally sunk in. It had been one thing to accept, with evidence, that Nick had experience beyond his years. But part of him hadn&rsquo;t been willing to take it any further than that. For weeks after waking up in New Orleans, he had been too numb to contemplate Nick&rsquo;s plight. That changed like someone flipped a switch when he watched the rocket-powered, grenade streak toward the car he had been in moments before.</p>
<p>From that moment on, living a new timeline over the foundation of the one that killed him, Holland marveled often on Nick’s resolve. Then without warning a clear epiphany and struck him with the force of an oncoming car.</p>
<p>Nick was an old man! By his own admission he&rsquo;d &ldquo;tried to hide from you guys a few times, but in the end, the Order was holding all the cards and had to come back to face the music. Learn what I could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not to mention next Frank comments about how slippery Holland was and how many lives he wasted getting him on board.</p>
<p>Holland stepped out into the parking lot. The air felt like a weighted blanket, pressing down on him, smothering his movements. With a quick vault onto the dock, he found shade and slowed. Next to the big roll-up doors was a single solid steel man door, Holland slid his key in. He turned the key, and a small panel popped open next to the door, revealing a numeric keypad. With a sigh and an explosion of gooseflesh, Holland typed in his access code.</p>
<p>What are the chances that Blackwell or Sonny bother to fill out the paperwork and send it to security? After all, I&rsquo;m dead.</p>
<p>Click! The electronic lock disengaged, and Holland pushed his way inside. The dark air was mercifully cool, but with the lights off he had to pause long enough for the shades of black to turn into bearing degrees of gray before he could make out the way forward. As his daylight blinded eyes adjusted, the exit light over his head revealed another set of doors that he knew but to the staircase. Six lights up. He paused at the door, pushing it open just a sliver with a gentle touch to listen in the open space.</p>
<p>Satisfied the way forward was clear, Holland opened the door fully and stepped into a well-lit hospital corridor. He was at the end of a long, windowed skywalk that connected back to the main hospital. He knew it would be business as usual on the other side, but this entire building was used exclusively by the Order and its myriad of agency players. The State approved the building for a massive remodel to coincide with the construction of the new state-of-the-art building. The remodel was now in its second year of delay, where it would stay until the order no longer needed it.</p>
<p>He now stood in front of the locket double doors leading to the chemo ward of the old building that he was unsurprised to find his key and access code worked here as well. As long as they hadn&rsquo;t moved Nick in the last three weeks, he knew exactly where he was going. The ward was empty, completely, which was a powerful sign that things were either progressing well and Nick would be busy all day or they had moved him after all.</p>
<p>Once he pushed opened the second door on the right, he surveyed the empty room. There were fresh indentations near the bottom corner of an otherwise neatly made bed. A single paper coffee cup with fresh brown stains around the lip in the wastebasket and a change of close stacked neatly underneath the television near several books. An all-day event it was then.</p>
<p>Out in the main hallway at the nurses’ station, Holland used his key to unlock the cabinet under the desk and withdrew the pushbutton phone. His fingers punching in the three-digit extension almost before he could lift the receiver. A line was ringing by the time he had it to his ear. His heart slowed to match the ring.
Ring, tha–thump…
Ring, tha-thump…
Ring, tha-thump…
Ring, &ldquo;hello?&rdquo; Tension melted away at the sound of Ahmed&rsquo;s halting voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahmed it&rsquo;s Carter. Now&rsquo;s the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carter! Allahu Akbar! It&rsquo;s good to hear your voice. I was beginning to think they got you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it was just as last time, only we know any different. But I just averted the timeline a little over an hour ago. We are in unfamiliar territory from here out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what&rsquo;s the plan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure yet. Can we clear the floor and have a debriefing with just the three of us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, give me 30 minutes and meet us in the imaging lab.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holland paced up and down the hallway, time moving like molasses. In the lounge, he busied himself with brewing a pot of coffee. He was somewhere amid cup number two at the 30-minute mark. After dumping the rest of his coffee and the pot, Holland teetered on the verge of jogging through the maze of corridors to the imaging lab.</p>
<p>A sensation like spiders crawling over the nape of his neck, adding urgency with every step. The rationally trained CIA agent kept his amygdala and check, stuffing down the lizard brain and controlling his emotions.</p>
<p>Nick and Ahmed were sitting at a long, low table that was new to the room since his last visit. Actually, the lab looked much changed. All the measuring and recording equipment was absent or pushed into the back corner against the wall behind a row of three large, freestanding chalkboards.</p>
<p>The table occupied two-thirds of the room’s width in front of the chalkboards, bisecting the space neatly. There were no chairs in between the table and the blackboards, leaving just enough room to stand at the board and reach the table behind you.</p>
<p>At the top of each board, in large bold strokes, was a title. From left to right they read, Operation, Effects, Hypotheses. There were neat stacks of paper on the table in front of the first two boards. Rows of items scrolled across each slate surface in rows of varying neatness below the headings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this?&rdquo; Holland asked as he arrived at the head of the table with a sweep of his arm.</p>
<p>Nick looked up with a smile. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; he answered while standing. In one smooth familiar gesture Nicholas Starr extended the hand, still beaming, and when Holland shook the hand Nick pulled him into a firm embrace. &ldquo;Damn, it&rsquo;s good to see you. Even knowing the plan, it was hard not to have doubts.&rdquo; He backed away and let go of Holland&rsquo;s hand while turning to face the boards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is where we are at.&rdquo; he walked around the table to stand in front of the first stack of paper with his back to the board. &ldquo;This timeline has been divergent for a while. Sonny stole Randall&rsquo;s journal and copied it. These,&rdquo; he said, placing a hand on top of the first stack. &ldquo;Are photocopies of the Journal, which we&rsquo;ve organized into these groupings. All references about operating the stone are here in these piles in front of the operation board. The piles closest to the boards are the ones most relevant and most clear the third stack in toward the middle of the table are the most vague/most questionable. Over here,&rdquo; he said, moving over a spot to his left. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same organizational scheme but for all references describing specific effects. We duplicated many of the pages to be included in multiple locations and come up with a numbering scheme based on its matrix location. We&rsquo;ve listed each item on the board with its corresponding matrix page number of re-reference and for the last five days since we came up with this organizational scheme with been doing nothing but trying to correlate operations with the facts to come up with a schema or owner&rsquo;s manual if you will for the damn thing. Every theory we come up with goes on that last board along with its referencing pages if it has any and then we work out how to test a hypothesis to determine the validity. On the backside of that chalkboard or all of our successes on the backside of the first job board or all of the known failures. We&rsquo;ve been at this 14 or 15 hours a day for the last week. So, that brings you up to speed. What have you been doing this month?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holland looked from Nick to Ahmed in admiration, impressed with the output as he perused the items on the board. Before launching into his narrative. When he finished, the three of them sat in silence for several minutes until Farouk broke in. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you let him live after everything he did. It&rsquo;s not a mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before another period of silence could stretch too far, Nick cleared his throat. &ldquo;Ahem. I get it, it&rsquo;s one thing to kill a man in a fight or to stop them from killing you, but to kill a man that&rsquo;s helpless… I can&rsquo;t say I would&rsquo;ve done it any differently. It doesn&rsquo;t matter though. You slowed him down enough to get Aimee and Jack safe. Darren is still a question mark, but we can’t do anything about that now. This is the most progress I&rsquo;ve made in figuring this thing out and I am reluctant to leave. It took so long to get here and I feel like I&rsquo;m finally close. I know the original plan was to get me out with or without the relic, but it&rsquo;s hard to imagine another location being as productive unless we all go together. I wouldn’t offend me if that&rsquo;s too much to ask, Ahmed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holland stood up, staring at the lists on the three boards before retreating to the other side to read that the successes and failures he had yet to explore. Calling out from behind, he continued the conversation. &ldquo;How long until Sonny gets back, do you think? And when he returns to think we can trust him? Have you… You know,&rdquo; he trailed off, unable to articulate the conclusion to that thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have, but only this time around,&rdquo; Nick explained. &ldquo;It was different last time when they killed you. I never showed him, so we can&rsquo;t count on him having a full realization. I&rsquo;m not entirely convinced that we can trust him at all. Too much of his personality depends on his relationship with Aimee. If anything goes wrong, there he&rsquo;ll revert. I&rsquo;ve already seen it happen before.&rdquo; All and continue to read the disproven theories on the backside of chalkboard one while contemplating next comments. &ldquo;This one here along with this one that you proved,&rdquo; Holland noticed poking his head around to wave Nick and Farouk over. Look here, the prime user can track all bifurcations of his timeline and initiation points of secondary users. You guys approved this one. Over here we have prime user can check on secondary iteration statuses and iteration flow but you put it in the disapprove category even though it looks like there were quite a few references here.&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sound like Farouk. He keeps telling me we need to come back to this one as well. It&rsquo;s easy enough for me to validate the first one and it&rsquo;s true for me and any sub-user as well but only if they can view their own iterations. I can see the point at which I initiated each of you on this or a previous iteration, and if I&rsquo;m looking at a previous iteration, I can see people I initiated and revoked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holland did a double-take at this, &ldquo;revoked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Nick continued. &ldquo;Sorry, let me think of an example… Oh I know, if the current plan doesn&rsquo;t work out and I want to take the next iteration off to regroup and I don&rsquo;t go through all the motions to re-initiate you at any point on the next timeline your status as a sub-user is revoked. If I come back to you later and re-initiate you and you&rsquo;ll see this on the front side as a working theory, but it&rsquo;s a little difficult to prove. We think you would be re-initiated but with no previous iteration knowledge or access. The reference to this section in the Journal is really confusing. Shaw contradicts himself at several points. Ahmed thinks he could choose to re-initiate with past knowledge or re-initiate as a blank slate. We disagree on this, so far I have seen nothing of that fine control that would even suggest being able to do something like that. Actually, a lot of Shaw’s writing, more than half the book really, is about getting everything perfect for his big “hand-off”.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what was that? The handoff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ahmed cleared his throat and stood up. &ldquo;May I?&rdquo; He asked Nick, who nodded. &ldquo;What we cannot discern from the writing is any indication of how long Shaw possessed the relic. In a lot of ways, he and Nicholas are very similar. Both of them profess to want to hand the stone off, but both of them are uneasy with the idea of handing it off to the wrong person. Shaw was convinced that he had unlocked the secret to removing a prime user, our words not his. This journal is the work of his last living iteration because he completed that handoff successfully. We know from both oral and some written histories of the Order, but they did this as part of an elaborate ritual.  By putting together pieces we’ve learned from Sonny and Blackwell we can trace the use of the relic to Shaw&rsquo;s rise of power in the order and to a schism that formed after the ceremony. We have no way of knowing if the relic transferred ownership immediately, but we know is that it did not transfer to Shaw&rsquo;s nephew as he intended. He included nothing of the actual ritual in the Journal except perhaps small pieces specific to the setup. But a sizeable chunk of the Journal covers the general preparations and considerations leading up to the ritual. I believe because of how Shaw writes in the Journal he was teaching him how to physically manipulate the relic in order to achieve these effects. To me, it&rsquo;s the only thing that makes sense because reading it from this point of view, as a notebook on important considerations and a reminder of in-person discussions, the book becomes a reference manual. Especially when you consider that if the book was handed down at the same time as the relic to a new user all the new user would have to do be to go back to the initiation point where everything is fresh and review common commands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick was nodding along and joined in at this point. &ldquo;Despite a few of our minor disagreements, I mostly share this view. Near the end of the journal is a meeting Shaw has with his nephew and a few handwritten notes that we assume were written by his nephew perhaps even at the same time Shaw wrote his.&rdquo; Nick smiled at Holland&rsquo;s raised eyebrow and lifted a finger. &ldquo;We think that because Shaw wrote in an odd shape. Here look, I can find the page right here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The paper in question was topmost on the second stack back from the edge of the table next to the operation blackboard. Nick handed to them with a small flourish, &quot; look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holland scanned the page, immediately noticing that the main body indented halfway through, to make room for several sentences along the side.</p>
<p><img src="/Journal.png" alt="Journal Entry"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much of a cipher, yeah more like a cheat sheet written by a zealot but a cheat sheet. So what you showed me was acting in the realm of sight according to this and activated when I hold my hand palm up, like Jesus showing the stigmata. Kind of dark but it gets the point across.&rdquo; Both Ahmed and Nicholas were staring at him, Nick’s cheeks turning pinkish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You two Einsteins didn&rsquo;t put that together, did you?&rdquo; Holland let out a genuine baritone chuckle. &ldquo;Which means you probably haven&rsquo;t tried any variation on palming a sling stone or various prostate prayer poses?.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ahmed stood up sheepishly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get the relic,&rdquo; he said, shaking his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if we’re not going anywhere I suppose I might as well get comfortable,&rdquo; Holland said while unbuttoning his top collar and removing his sport coat.</p>
