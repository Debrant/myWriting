<h1>Chapter 25</h1>

<br><br>
<p>Jack leaned back into the cushions of the wicker beach chair and sipped his Mai Tai. He had an unbleached, wide-brimmed straw hat and an oversize pair of Elton John sunglasses as much to hide the bruising on his face as to protect him from the sun. Aimee left him with an open tab to wait. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get too drunk. We still have things to do,&rdquo; she had told him. But that seemed hours ago.</p>
<p>Sometimes, like now, when Jack relaxed and his breathing was shallow, he forgot about the pain, and the anxiety melted away into the background. The trip here had been anything but relaxing. Aimee drove hard from Pennsylvania to Miami, stopping just once to rest. She had slept on the hired boat but took them to Cuba, where they had spent the day purchasing fake identification for him and avoiding the local police.</p>
<p>From Havana, they flew to Santiago, where Aimee threw away the purchased documents. She must have bought multiple sets because she produced more before they booked another island hopper to San Juan, Puerto Rico. It arrived here on the island in the late afternoon, only a few hours ago. Aimee had outfitted him in semi-resident tourist attire before leaving him to the side of a public square where a Fourth of July celebration was in full swing.</p>
<p>Jack marveled at the mix of white, brown, and black skin on display as people drank, danced, and even broke out into the occasional song. He had experienced nowhere like this in his life. Narrow cobblestone streets crowded by pastel Spanish stonework buildings. On the drive into town, they passed an idyllic coastline with white sandy beaches and the smells renewed his appetite for the first time in days. Combined with the openness and generosity of the people, it was a paradise, but one with a troubling undercurrent. There was a sense of American pride, the road piggyback with the resentment for the wealth and privilege that the mainland had. Here in central San Juan, only the hints of poverty threatened the facade of paradise, but his native guide had already tainted Jack&rsquo;s view.</p>
<p>Just weeks ago torrential rains had flooded several rivers on the north side of the island, west of San Juan. The town car driver fumed at the lack of government response. Then there was Aimee, who must&rsquo;ve told him half a dozen times not to leave the cantina with anyone. The owner was a friend of her mother&rsquo;s and said he would keep an eye out for trouble. Now, it all seemed like a distant memory, the worry, the fear, and the pain. An aching reminder of the previous week forced Jack to roll sideways in the chair to take the pressure off of his bruised ribs. He took another drink and went back to watching the crowd. He could already feel the pinpricks of improved circulation across to his cheeks and the cotton ball barrier keeping troubling thoughts away. Jack looked in through the open storm shutters and waived for another drink.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s too drunk? A couple of more should be fine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tio! Lo tienes jumeta!&rdquo; Someone was lifting him from his chair by his armpits. He flopped his head to the side. &ldquo;Whoer you?&rdquo;
Amy&rsquo;s familiar voice rang out from behind the graying brown-skinned face of the man that was lifting him. &ldquo;Jack, I told you not to get drunk! Ay bendito!&rdquo; She looked disappointed. He should say something, explain that he was fine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said not two drunk I&rsquo;m only one drunk.&rdquo; He laughed so hard at the joke he made that the old man struggle to keep him upright.</p>
<p>She was speaking Spanish again, only this time it was too fast for him to even pick out the words. The old man slung one of Jack&rsquo;s arms over his shoulder and walked him to the curb where he pushed him into the backseat of a car, face first shoving his legs and after him.</p>
<p>Jack tried to sit up, but between the terms of the cobblestones bumping the car up and down, he couldn&rsquo;t seem to get his head up high enough to look out the window. Every bounce made him blink. Each time it was harder to open his eye again. His stomach threatened to turn for a moment before sleep found him.</p>
<p>Sunlight woke him bright on his face. Jack found himself in a small room with a double-hung window with the top pane pulled down to let in a breeze that smelled of dirt. The bed, too small for him by several inches, creaked as he looked around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hoy, mano, you up? I am making breakfast. There are clean clothes in the closet. Take a shower and join us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Refreshed, Jack found himself ravenous as he navigated the cool tile floor into the primary room of the house. Behind him was a small hallway, the bathroom with a standup shower on one side, and the room slept in on the other. The room was bright, with walls of painted white stone covered in photos and religious paintings. A small pile of shoes stacked next to an entry door on his left open to the staircase the double back to a second floor. In the nook, under the staircase, was a functional kitchen, where Aimee busied herself at the stove.</p>
<p>A large wooden table with seating for 10 occupied most of the center space, with a sampling of small pastries and bread laid out in its center. Gauze curtains billowed inward from an open glass door that extended onto a gravel patio, ending at a cinderblock wall painted in sky-blue. &ldquo;Where are we?&rdquo; Jack asked as he stepped toward the table.
&ldquo;This house belongs to my cousin and we are in Salinas. Well, a little outside of it. We are on the edge of my family&rsquo;s farms. Hey, no touching until everybody&rsquo;s seated!&rdquo; She snapped with a smile as he reached for a pastry. &ldquo;A few of my cousins will be here in a minute, along with my auntie and uncle. Have you ever had revoltillo before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until yesterday, I hadn&rsquo;t even tried any Puerto Rican food. What are those things,&rdquo; he asked, pointing at the cinnamon roll-shaped pastries covered in powdered sugar?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pan de Mallorca is like a doughnut, you can have one before breakfast,&rdquo; she said with a laugh. Jack was a little in awe of her. The hard edge of her no-nonsense persona had evaporated into domesticity. Is this is what Sonny saw in her? He spent most of the last several days trying to figure out how those two fit together. From what little he&rsquo;d witnessed of their time together, she almost appeared to think for him half of the time. Sonny didn&rsquo;t seem like the type of person who would stand for that very long.
Jack considered most people intellectually boring. Sonny fell into that category, but Aimee had made him uncomfortable with her sharp observational skills and keen analysis. Now here was a woman as accomplished in homemaking as she was in her career. He liked Sonny, but the man was a snake and didn&rsquo;t deserve someone like her. &ldquo;I can wait. You need a hand with anything?&rdquo; If you got close to her, he could warn her about Sonny. Maybe she would realize there were better options out there, or here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay bendito! No,&rdquo; she said, making a face. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want you ruining your first impression before anyone can get to know you. Let them think you are a man.&rdquo; she gave him a wink which made up for the sting of embarrassment. &ldquo;Here, take this it&rsquo;s coffee, but we call it caf√© con leche. Sit on the patio and wait for everybody else.&rdquo;
The meal was a joyous, delicious affair. Jack impressed everyone with his ability to remember and pronounce names, but afterward, he felt lost in the malaise of inadequacy. Growing up, his family life had been full of terse standoffish moments and outright arguments. He and his siblings and their cousins had bickered, fought amongst each other. Nothing like the genuine affection and camaraderie he had witnessed at breakfast.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, they expected him to help around the farm while he stayed here and spent the day following behind Fabian and Andres, who tried to teach him how to be useful. They showed without irritation or condensation even when he couldn&rsquo;t get the hang of something. However, Jack could tell that he had all the skill of an eight-year-old in farming and now sat alone on the patio staving off self-recrimination, waiting for Aimee to return from the market. He could hear her laughter coming up the road several minutes before the front door opened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hola, Jack!&rdquo; she called, setting down a basket of fresh produce on the table before joining him on the patio. &ldquo;I have been talking to the ladies at the market, and we came up with a way you can help. Don&rsquo;t give me that look. I talked to Andres as well. Anyway, I would you feel about teaching English for a few hours a week at the schoolhouse? If you&rsquo;re interested, sister Mary Catherine would also like you to tutor some of the older kids in math and physics in the afternoons. What do you think? You might like it. Plus you could do real good around here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Relief and admiration competed for his emotional state, followed by a sense of trepidation. She very skilled at this, reading people, sensing what they needed or wanted in a situation.</p>
<p>He blew out a breath with a grin. &ldquo;That would be amazing. Your cousins were great, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure I would just slow them down. So this would be at a Catholic school?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all Catholic schools here. And it&rsquo;s in Salinas proper, so you would need to drive there, but before we go giving you the key to one of the family cars, we need to lie down the ground rules.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever you say, Aimee, I just have one question. Not that I don&rsquo;t appreciate what you&rsquo;re doing, but how long will I have to hang out here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I not sure, Jack. Some very important people think that you&rsquo;re dead right now and it would be bad if they learned otherwise. I can&rsquo;t tell what is going to happen with Sonny, he&rsquo;s a good man underneath it all, but his family has a stranglehold on his morality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you talk him into letting me go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only suggested it and helped him work out the method, he didn&rsquo;t need talking into it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if you hadn&rsquo;t been there I&rsquo;d be dead now, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She wouldn&rsquo;t meet his eye but gave a small shrug. Jack reached across the table, taking her left hand in both of his. &ldquo;I owe you my life. I understand that, but I also appreciate that you&rsquo;re very good at what you do. So tell me what you have planned because I don&rsquo;t think it involves me staying with your family forever.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Of course not. Okay, cards on the table then. But you first, tell me what happened in New Orleans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He told her everything from how Sonny kept dangling a job with the US government when they&rsquo;d first met to how he explained about the order of the founders and given them cash to track down his son. &ldquo;And when I saw him walking up the street with that rifle aimed at my son, everything went white-hot. The next thing I knew there was blood coming out of the guy&rsquo;s head and his partner was trying to punch me. I ran away, I would&rsquo;ve gotten away too, but Sonny was there at the end of the block. You know the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a hard glinted her eyes and a grim set to her mouth, &ldquo;no I don&rsquo;t think that I do. What happened after that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he finished telling her about the beating, he could tell she was fuming. She retreated to the kitchen, uttering Spanish curses under her breath. A heartbeat later she returned with two beers handing one to Jack she said, &ldquo;he told me the cops beat you.&rdquo; With a practiced twist, she opened the beer and took a long pull. &ldquo;No matter, it changes nothing now. Jack,&rdquo; she motioned at his beer bottle, &ldquo;I think you might be an alcoholic. This brings me to one of our ground rules for your stay. You&rsquo;re welcome to drink whatever is in the fridge, but no drinking in public and no going to the cantina to get more. Okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not an alcoholic. I like to drink, but it&rsquo;s just for fun. So that won&rsquo;t be a problem,&rdquo; he promised as a sinking feeling akin to panic turned over in his gut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, someone will keep the refrigerator stocked, and on most days, my family will be in and out of here to cook at least breakfast and dinner. Fend for yourself at lunch. Rule number two: don&rsquo;t get involved with any of my cousins and don&rsquo;t sleep with any of the students. If you&rsquo;re here long enough for romance, a male from the woman&rsquo;s family will value that it&rsquo;s okay for you to talk to her. Okay?&rdquo; He gave a nod. The panic was turning into cramps. &ldquo;Last rule, no taking the car further than Salinas or on days when you&rsquo;ve been drinking, and that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;
She took another sip and then started again. &ldquo;oh, and I almost forgot, you cannot go by Jack. What about your middle name, Christopher right? Could you get used to going by Christopher?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, I guess.&rdquo; He liked her better when she was around her family. &ldquo;So now it&rsquo;s your turn. How are you and Sonny going to get me and my son out of this mess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, first off, it isn&rsquo;t just Sonny. I have been working with Holland off and on since May. Around the time, Sonny and I began dating. Holland and Nick have developed a good working relationship, according to Holland they trust each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you telling me this? Sonny said Holland is a career double agent and that I shouldn&rsquo;t trust him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sonny struggles with his own narrative sometimes. All and has never been a double agent he worked for the US government most of his life. Anyway, I&rsquo;m telling you this because I want you to know that someone is looking out for Nick on the inside he&rsquo;s not alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the inside of where? What do you mean, not alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack, when Sonny took you into custody, Nick turned himself over to Holland. He&rsquo;s in one of our research facilities in Syracuse New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Research facilities?&rdquo; He was missing something. &ldquo;wait, you mean worked most of his life for the government? Who Holland and Sonny work for now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fair question? What has Sonny told you about why he and Holland were looking for Nick in the first place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a lot. I mean, he told me about the Order. Is that who they, you all, work for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyebrows shot up, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it, that man can be such an idiot sometimes!&rdquo; She continued, still shaking her head. &ldquo;I wonder if he even remembers he confided in you. Jesus, first he let you in, and then he beat you? I swear he is self-sabotaging. Okay, back to it. Yeah, Sonny and Holland are both members of the Order, I am an employee. They run a non-profit research group that serves as the backbone and administrative structure for the Order itself. You got me way off-topic. Sort of, I mean it all ties back into the Order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just who, what is the Order?&rdquo; Jack intervened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know anymore, but that&rsquo;s neither here nor there. Were talking about Nick and why the government, or at least the Order, was looking for him. Near the end of last year, you and your ex-wife sent your son to Medford to stay with his grandfather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack interrupted again, &ldquo;I knew Danny Avery would show up in this somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From what I&rsquo;ve heard, you have the wrong idea about him. His only involvement in any of this was trying to protect Nick. The point is over the last year we&rsquo;ve learned that Nick found something in the woods. Something that many people, especially members at the top of my organization, have been looking for&hellip;&rdquo; Aimee&rsquo;s gaze unfocused, &ldquo;for a very long time. This thing, they called a relic, is important enough to pull both Holland and Pera to be pulled off their long-term assignments and sent to investigate with an unlimited budget. If I had to guess that budget is already running in millions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack just stared for several seconds, trying to put the pieces together in his head. &ldquo;Are you being serious, what kind of thing is this relic? How can they even be sure Nick found it? What the hell are you saying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Calm down, Jack. I&rsquo;m trying to help you. According to Sonny, his family&rsquo;s been searching for this object for at least the last hundred and 20 years. He says that they lost track of it in the mid-1820s after his great-great-great-uncle or something died. They have made it a priority to get it back ever since. He describes it as a kind of magic rock, but I&rsquo;m not a fan of magic. I&rsquo;m with Arthur C Clarke on this one if you know what I mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It impressed Jack. He never met a woman who would quote or reference science fiction authors. Or at least none that looked like her. &ldquo;I do, and I&rsquo;m glad to hear you say it, although I&rsquo;m a little fuzzy though on why they think this thing is important. Just what&rsquo;s it supposed to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the million-dollar question.&rdquo; Jack prided himself on being able to identify people&rsquo;s emotional needs, and her outburst told him that Sonny had not been forthcoming on the subject, either.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, so you don&rsquo;t know. Get to the part where you tell me how Nick is the answer for them and what they&rsquo;re doing with him now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right, the device, as I like to call it, to avoid sounding like a nut job. The device has certain operational properties that admit high-energy high-frequency radiation spikes or bursts. That nonprofit organization that I was telling you about earlier, the one I work for, donates millions of dollars to research institutions around the world for access to live data from instrumentation. A radio telescope in southern Oregon picked up the initial burst and our scientists tracked it to the rough geographic area which he came from. They could recover the device, but no one could figure out how to activate it again. That&rsquo;s where Carter and Sonny come in. They were on the ground at the recovery in found evidence that someone had already found it. There were tire tracks nearby, and the device looked as if someone had buried it under the shallow dirt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they tracked that to Nick? You said Nick and agent Holland were working together. Does that mean Nick knows about the device?&rdquo; He was still missing something, but now his mind flashed overall how Nick had been different since coming back from that trip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and he could show one of our scientists and agent Holland how to operate the device.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he showed them how to use it, why was Sonny so dead set on finding him still?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure.&rdquo; for the first time in their conversation she looked hesitant, almost embarrassed. &ldquo;Carter Holland recommended me for this operation, it was a kind of promotion for me. Before he and Nick started working together, we were all working together to find your son. We had a big stakeout at a casino in Vegas that turned&hellip;&rdquo; She stumbled, starting and stopping several times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think Sonny told me about this. He said Nick gave him a head injury, I think he said Nick attacked him and another operative? I still understand how that&rsquo;s even possible, is a big kid but he still just a kid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re wrong. I don&rsquo;t have a clue what that thing does, but I can tell you Nicholas Starr is not just a kid. I was there, tied into the camera feeds for the operation. Nick played us. He avoided direct camera contact, took down veteran tactical agent without being spotted by anybody in a public casino, in the middle of the day. I figured out where Nick was headed and Sonny cut him off before he could get to his motorcycle. I can&rsquo;t describe it, and analyzing people is what I do. Your son read the situation and set an ambush in a span of seconds. Perhaps he planned it all ahead of time, which seems unlikely, but he knew where to go and what to do, and how Sonny would react. It&rsquo;s the only way I can describe it. He ducked back into the casino and disappeared when Sonny came through he tackled him. You&rsquo;ve seen Sonny, the man&rsquo;s a beast, he knows how to handle himself. But that fight lasted all of about five seconds. There was about an hour there afterward where we all thought Sonny might die. None of us realized how serious his injury was at first. We all just thought he got knocked out. Some guys were even teasing him a little. What we didn&rsquo;t realize was that his brain was swelling. I&rsquo;m still not sure what tipped me off, but if we hadn&rsquo;t taken him to the hospital, he would&rsquo;ve died. I&rsquo;m not saying that Nick is a bad person. Sonny was on a bit of a power trip back then, and he fought back as hard as he could. But there&rsquo;s no way that kid is a normal 15-year-old with a couple of years of Tae Kwon To.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you what, think this device or relic gave him superpowers?&rdquo; Jack reacted by rote. Incredulous near outrage was one of his favorite responses to magical thinking. On the inside, he kept playing back every interaction he had with his son in the last six months.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but I can&rsquo;t explain it. In the end, it doesn&rsquo;t matter, Nick turned himself in and he&rsquo;s working with Holland and our team and if anybody can figure out how to get him out of there it&rsquo;s Carter Holland.&rdquo;</p>
