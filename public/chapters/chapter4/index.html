<h1>Chapter 4</h1>

<br><br>
<p>Nick followed his grandfather into the cabin, the dogs pushing past them through the entrance. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna go get washed up, you need in the John before I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danny waved him off, &ldquo;no sir, by all means, help yourself,&rdquo; he retorted chuckling.</p>
<p>Nick had the hot water streaming over his shoulders in no time. The mineral &ldquo;hard water&rdquo; had a dry feeling on his skin. The smell was a familiar memory. Being under it and remembering it at the same time made him feel dizzy. He turned the water off to lather up, thinking about football. The Chicago Bears to be precise. In January of 1986, he had watched the Bears win the Super Bowl with his dad. Sitting on a scattering of secondhand throw pillows at his dad&rsquo;s apartment. His father&rsquo;s new girlfriend, Marry, was in a state of perpetual irritation.</p>
<p>Mary and Nick hadn&rsquo;t seen eye to eye from day one. He had tried to win her over countless times but never succeeded. Not until his father, Jack, had passed away leaving her a widow at 72 did she ever warm to Nick. When her children grew distant in the years that followed she would call to talk with Nick.</p>
<p>She would often talk about Jack. She would say something like, &ldquo;you know your dad and I would have been married forty-five years this spring.&rdquo; She&rsquo;d also sneak in &ldquo;we were always so proud of you.&rdquo; Which was an outright lie or at least a liberal rewriting of their shared history.</p>
<p>That first apartment of theirs had been a dim, brown one-bedroom off of a busy street. There were only two chairs in the entire place. They both looked borrowed from some long-forgotten diner. The large lumpy throw pillows of Persian descent served in place of the couch.
The one extravagant feature of the apartment was the books. They sat on shelves constructed of cinderblock and pressboard. The books stretched from corner to corner on each of the longest two walls of the living room. The bottom run of books sitting on the floor, the highest ones brushing the popcorn ceiling.</p>
<p>Nick and his younger brother, Saul, had come to watch the Super Bowl at &ldquo;dad&rsquo;s house.&rdquo; Jack had made a big show of buying chips, junk food, and soda. It was the first time the three of the Starr men had gathered since the family split apart in the summer of &lsquo;85.</p>
<p>The emotions of that moment were long forgotten, having smothered by what would become one of the most famous Super Bowls in history. The Bears&rsquo; were a pop culture phenomenon. The Super Bowl Shuffle played for weeks leading up to the game. Little biopics about each of the Bears' starting players littered throughout the program. Sportscasters always play to history. This was an event that warranted the extra commentary.</p>
<p>As Nick dried himself off he managed to drag himself forward, backward?? He had difficulty remembering all the details of that game. He could recall almost nothing about the 1984 season. He knew that they would win the first round of the playoffs. They then lost to San Francisco who would go on to win the championship that year. But even that was hazy.</p>
<p>He would be listening for details that would confirm his memories. If events progressed in the same manner it would be easy for a betting man to make a small fortune. If he could figure out a way to place the bets and collect them as a minor. He could be all but set for life before he turned 18.
He finished dressing and made his way back out to the living and dining section of the cabin. The galley kitchen sat inside the footprint of the old trailer at the far end. The TV area at the other, two low recliners book-ended a plush loveseat and sat facing the television. A large walnut coffee table straddling the transition between the trailer and cabin. The Television sat alone at the edge of the cabin space.</p>
<p>Danny sat in his recliner trying to look casual. The mood was anything but. Pent-up anticipation lingered in the air. An assortment of snack foods sat on the coffee table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Jeannie,&rdquo; Nick questioned, moving to sink into the loveseat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s with the school board, annual Christmas party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, you don&rsquo;t have to hang around here to keep me company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hah!.&rdquo; Danny decreed eyes twinkling, &quot; let&rsquo;s see I can sit here watching football with my grandson. I can eat food my doctor complains about. Or&hellip; Go hang out with a bunch of small-town educators trying not to treat me like the town idiot.&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, when you put it like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick took a handful of corn chips and scooped some bean dip onto a paper Dixie plate. He leaned back into the loveseat to munch with a grin.
&ldquo;We are live from the Pontiac Silverdome where the Chicago Bears seek to end the regular season on a high note. The audio sounded stretched and thin to Nick&rsquo;s ears.</p>
<p>They sat in a semi-awkward silence for the first 20 minutes of the game. As the skills mismatch between the two teams became plain, Danny broke the verbal drought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really showed a lot of talent out here. On this trip I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s trying to work his way to something and having trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While curious about Danny, he couldn&rsquo;t shake the implications of his earlier realizations. Ideas and thoughts ricocheted through his mind. He had committed to preventing Danny&rsquo;s death. Something about the decision left him feeling hopeless. The reality of being 14 was overwhelming. He had suffered more random erections in the last two weeks than he would have thought possible.</p>
<p>At times he felt like an alien entity shared his mind. Sometimes he was the alien. Watching from a remote position as his body did things that should be no longer possible. He had no explanation for how any of it could happen.</p>
<p>If I allow that &ldquo;souls&rdquo; are a thing in reality. Then if a soul returned its younger mind, how could it then have future memories? Memories are physical and chemical chains inside the brain?</p>
<p>It was a mystery. He had no choice but to accept ignorance and trust in the cornerstones of logic, patience, and reason. The ability to continue working in a state of ignorance had always been a strength. Faith that he would in time connect the dots had been a cornerstone to some of his greatest successes.</p>
<p>For the time being, he needed autonomy, and for that, his best bet was betting. He needed proof! His frustration was only increasing as it became clear that the 1984 NFL season held no insights for him. This game was revealing nothing at all.</p>
<p>Nick sighed, reaching forward to refill his plate.
The hunger!</p>
<p>Deciding to focus on the moment he reasoned that if riled Danny up a bit the man would get to the point. &ldquo;Well I&rsquo;m glad you noticed me doing all the work,&rdquo; he tossed back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smartass, real funny. You must get that from my side of the family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danny climbed out of the chair to walk into the kitchen pausing to turn down the TV as he did it. Nick heard the unmistakable sound of ice cubes pinging around the bottom of a rocks glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember you drinking, what&rsquo;s your poison?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He came to the counter in time to see Danny pouring a bottle of Glenmorangie over crackling cubes. He watched Danny swirl the cubes to melt them and open up the bouquet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who would&rsquo;ve thought,&rdquo; Nick mumbled under his breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every man who drinks is not a drunk,&rdquo; Danny griped, mistaking Nick&rsquo;s comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mom&rsquo;s family like to say that about me, but it was never true&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No that&rsquo;s not what I&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait what?&rdquo; Somewhere pieces of family history fell into place. &ldquo;Mom&rsquo;s grandad, your father-in-law, never liked you, and I think I know why.&rdquo;
It was Danny&rsquo;s turn to look confused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christopher Sayer was a drunk and a mean one, I bet.&rdquo; Nick reasoned. &ldquo;I put a few pieces together over the years, but I get it now. He sobered up and he hated everyone who drank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plus my family was Welsh and that old bastard always said that Welshmen were worse than the Irish.&rdquo; Danny flushed, &ldquo;shouldn&rsquo;t have said that.&rdquo;
Nick watched his grandfather with a new feeling of admiration.</p>
<p>He won&rsquo;t slander the man even now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, you weren&rsquo;t supposed to hear that comment,&rdquo; Nick confessed with a smirk. &ldquo;I would ask you to keep your ears off of conversations to myself. They are private.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jokes aside, I don&rsquo;t know how I could ever explain what I was thinking but I wasn&rsquo;t judging.&rdquo; They both paused for a few heartbeats looking at each other.</p>
<p>We need to move past this. How can I explain this to him? Those motions, that habit, like watching a mirror. Hell, I even drink the same damn scotch. I don&rsquo;t remember him drinking whiskey. Maybe I saw it on a shelf or maybe even heard the cubes clinking without knowing it. I guess we can call it inherited good taste.</p>
<p>Danny was staring at Nick with an arched eyebrow, &ldquo;a penny for your thoughts kid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Da pry-eyed oh Doon-arc Firth,&rdquo; Nick blurted in a heavy Scottish brogue. &ldquo;Do you know why the Morangie has always been so smooth?&rdquo;
Amusement tightened all Danny&rsquo;s features, &ldquo;no do enlighten me with your worldly ways&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stills and casks,&rdquo; he waited a moment for dramatic effect. &ldquo;Like geese, long-necked copper stills. As tall as a giraffe they say, it allows them to capture more aroma in the off-gassing. And they all but started the process of using recycled bourbon and port barrels for flavor and color.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth are they teaching in middle school these days? Or am I to believe you developed such knowledge and appreciation over your years of drinking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Touché, score one for the Welshman, it&rsquo;s something my dad talks about a lot, booze&rdquo;</p>
<p>The light of amusement and humor was leaving Danny&rsquo;s eyes. Now a chasm was forming between them. Nick imagined that Danny knew his deception.
How can I explain it to him, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nick, what happened on your little adventure with the dogs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pulled back to earth by the change in direction, Nick met Danny&rsquo;s eyes.
&ldquo;What you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, you been the consummate gentleman here. I&rsquo;ve enjoyed the company and appreciate the help, but&hellip;&rdquo; he met Nick&rsquo;s eyes the question unspoken.</p>
<p>That familiar soul-crushing drift. Panic beginning to show its head. He could not continue the ruse and yet he knew he could not explain the truth. An attempt then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Danny,&rdquo; he stammered, &ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, look Hoss, I don&rsquo;t know what this is, but if it&rsquo;s too hard to talk about that&rsquo;s okay. Let me share something with you that&rsquo;s been on my mind for a while now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The turmoil inside Nick was still churning, but the desperation abated some.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We both know how this game is going to turn out. Why don&rsquo;t we go back sit down? You and me, we need to talk.&rdquo;
Danny&rsquo;s stride was confident as he moved back into the other room, pausing to turn off the game. His smile as he settled into the recliner again relieved more of Nick&rsquo;s apprehension.</p>
<p>Something happened then, that was new to this reality. Danny opened up about his past. His tone was light, but there was no mistaking that he was sharing traumatic experiences. Nick listened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jimmy was a good guy underneath all that bluster,&rdquo; Danny remarked as he drew to the end of his story. &ldquo;The problem was he never let anyone in. The one time he did he was drunk and scared. He was talking to one of the infantry boys. I can&rsquo;t remember who he was, but Jimmy knew him. He was there by his bed talking all about his family. Talking about life&rsquo;s pain and trying to ease the young man&rsquo;s passing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw him go in and followed to say hello but stopped when I heard him talking. He wouldn&rsquo;t look at me for a week after he realized I&rsquo;d overheard. After he got over it, we would talk about our lives in the quiet moments between the dying. You need people in your life that you can talk to, be yourself with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes you remind me of Jimmy, so moody, so private. But I see that you are already more mature in a lot of ways than he ever was.&rdquo;
They sat for a long moment in silence. &ldquo;Nick, I&rsquo;m asking you again what happened? Why did you leave Jeannie&rsquo;s lunchbox? What happened to your hand?&rdquo;
There it was, Danny knew Nick was keeping a secret and wanted answers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something did happen, I don&rsquo;t know how to explain. I can&rsquo;t tell you what I was thinking before it happened. I&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must&rsquo;ve blacked out. But my life flashed before my eyes. I mean that in the most literal sense. I can&rsquo;t explain it. You have to trust me on this. It is the only way I know how .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&quot; I saw my entire life, not what I&rsquo;ve lived already, I didn&rsquo;t see any of that. I saw the rest of it. All of it. In the end, I was older than you with my family gathering at my hospital bed as I was dying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He let the confession hang there in the air for a minute. To his surprise, Danny looked neutral, not accepting but not skeptical. He was listening.
&ldquo;I remembered this trip, this thing that we did with the garage, it meant so much to me. That&rsquo;s why I worked hard to make it better this time. To say thank you. That&rsquo;s why I said, who would&rsquo;ve thought. Because I saw myself doing exactly the same repeatedly. Dropping ice cubes in a glass, swirling scotch over them as you did. Gave me a déjà vu when I saw you doing it. Made it all feel so real again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danny took a drink of his scotch and didn&rsquo;t say anything for a good stretch. &ldquo;That is quite a story. One that I&rsquo;m not keen to dismiss given everything that we&rsquo;ve talked about and I&rsquo;ve seen you do over the last two weeks. I can&rsquo;t take it on faith however so, how might we settle this in a manner that would allow satisfaction?&rdquo; He continued his reasoning, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a point I like to get out right in front when confronting an argument. And that&rsquo;s what,&rdquo;
Nick interjected, &ldquo;evidence are you willing to accept that will change your mind? Yes, I&rsquo;ve often said that as well, let me think on this.&rdquo;
Did I  take that from him as well? How much of who I became, was me trying to live up to how I remembered him?</p>
<p>He sat back gesturing in the air, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s math, physics, there&rsquo;s history. I think though that the most likely way that I can convince you is through shared experiences. Or knowledge of shared spaces if that makes sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the next hour or so the two men settled into an easy back and forth. They talked about places they visited. About the details, they remembered from each. Finally, Danny sat back in his recliner and blew out a long breath. &ldquo;All right for the sake of my frazzled nerves let&rsquo;s say that we&rsquo;re on the same page. I can&rsquo;t reconcile it, but I believe it. One thing though, what about the fire pit and that, that thing in the hole? What about your hand?&rdquo;
Nick did a physical double take. He didn&rsquo;t remember a fire or any strange objects. &ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Monday morning when you were making breakfast, I took the ATV out to retrieve the lunchbox. I found where you left it and your gloves. They were sitting right next to a little campfire except that it wasn&rsquo;t any kind of fire I have ever seen. There was a hole in the middle with some kind of rock in the center. Bigger than a golf ball but almost triangular. Not a natural object, too symmetrical, is any of this ringing bell?&rdquo; Nick shook his head dumbfounded. &ldquo;Anyway, I almost picked the thing up. It gave me the heebie-jeebies something fierce and I buried it instead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some fog clouded his mind, there was a hint of recollection but he was unable to pierce it. &ldquo;Can we go take a look at it tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can, we should,&rdquo; downing the last half of his scotch, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna turn in now.&rdquo; Danny marched into the kitchen to begin cleaning up. &ldquo;Tomorrow we should talk about when we&rsquo;re gonna call Jane, I&rsquo;m sure she wants you back for Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
