<h1>Chapter 28</h1>

<br><br>
<p>Nobody used the loading docks on the backside of the hospital. The entire North wing was officially closed, abandoned really by the fifth sixth and seventh floors of the North wing made up the semipermanent research facility led by Dr. Blackwell. But she had official roles here, as did Sonny and Farouk. Which meant there was no reason for the white Ford sedan to be this far down the service road.</p>
<p>Darren Horne had almost missed the car and would have if it had been anything other than white. Tucked to the side of the service road under a large tree, he wasn&rsquo;t able to see it from the gate at the entrance or from the roof of the West Wing, where he normally watched Sonny and team come and go from the north building. As luck would have it, Darren had made a judgment call based on routine and ducked out for a quick cup of coffee and to use a real bathroom. While returning to his makeshift stakeout office on the roof, he had spotted the white bumper while slowing on the Skyway to take a sip of coffee.</p>
<p>After making his way down the back stairs and out into the woods behind the north wing, he found the car empty, a rental sticker showing prominently at the top of the front windshield. After backtracking to make sure that the gate was closed there and made his way through the underbrush, aiming for a prime spot, which would give him a view of the north service dock.</p>
<p>At the top, equipped with a pair of binoculars, Darren squeezed himself prone under the edge of a large spruce tree. Moving the branches aside to make a viewpoint, he scanned the small concrete parking next to the dock. A man and a woman, both sitting on the edge of the with their legs dangling in the air, faced each other in apparent seriousness. With a few twists of his index finger, the image became clear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Son of a bitch! Sonny, what the fuck are you doing?&rdquo; He couldn&rsquo;t believe it. A week of following Sonny around thinking that Randall Junior was off of his rocker only to find this. Darren watched the two talking while they held hands. Somehow, not being able to hear what they said made this scene more intimate. Suddenly Randall&rsquo;s worries about Sonny&rsquo;s loyalty didn&rsquo;t seem so far-fetched.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d always felt that Sonny understood the real world. There was no ultimate right or wrong. Everybody thought they were in the right. Morality was a system of value judgments taught by social contract from the top down. Sonny had impressed him with his willingness to do what it took to get the job done without thinking about it too much and without reflecting. They were kindred spirits in that regard, over time becoming trusted allies, if not friends.</p>
<p>Now though, looking at him conspiring with that commie sympathizer made his blood boil. Delgado was a fine piece of work. There was no question about that, but everything in Sonny&rsquo;s body language was of a man in love. And that was dangerous.</p>
<p>His mind did not want to accept it, and he began replaying the events that led them to this moment. The Randall&rsquo;s believed that Sonny may have faked Jack Starr&rsquo;s death, which was the main reason they had assigned Darren to tail him twenty-four seven. It still made little sense. He knew Sonny and Jack had been close, so it hadn&rsquo;t seemed like an odd request to share a last drink. Darren had waited at a switchback on the trail a little over a quarter mile away until he heard the gunshot.</p>
<p>In hindsight, it seemed strange that Sonny had covered the body so quickly. It took Darren four or five minutes to walk back. At the time it hadn&rsquo;t seemed unreasonable to think that Sonny just wanted to get it over with and didn&rsquo;t want to look at the face of his dead friend. Evidence that Sonny was doing what had to be done. But now, he realized, it would&rsquo;ve been more than enough time for Sonny and Jack to arrange a fake body at the bottom of the grave. None of that worked without Delgado though, Jack was not a guy you could turn loose in a forest and expect to stay off the radar.</p>
<p>Still, it was hard to swallow. Sonny hadn&rsquo;t hesitated to make the call, setting up Holland. They&rsquo;d arrived at the farm to find Randall Junior waiting for them next to his vintage Aston Martin. Without sparing time for hellos, he handed the keys to Sonny and stood with Darren as he drove away. &ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; Randall had demanded as the taillights disappeared in the distance.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later they&rsquo;d arrived at the car park, a large state-of-the-art garage capable of storing the several dozen cars with ample room for more. Randall le-, Darren to a locked metal cabinet on the back wall where they kept the tools. After unlocking it and opening the doors, he stepped back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holland is on his way. Take this and wait for him to reach the old bridge, when he gets to the turn immediately after blow him off the road!&rdquo; Randall pushed a large molded plastic case at Darren. &ldquo;I assume you know how to use one of these?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Surprised by the heft as he took the case and placed it on the floor to open it. &ldquo;Wowie&rdquo;,&quot; he whistled. Inside, nestled deep within protective foam, was a rocket powered grenade launcher with three shells arranged above it.&ldquo;Yes, sir! So the plan is to make the car go over the edge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, return here when it&rsquo;s done I like your impressions from the operation in New Orleans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Darren had done exactly as ordered after watching the rack long enough to make sure no one climbed out of the burning, twisted metal. Back at the farm, Randall had probed him for details and had become upset when Darren had revealed that Sonny and Aimee were sleeping together.</p>
<p>In Darren&rsquo;s mind, that had been the start of it all. Randall Junior had been furious, immediately jumping to worst-case scenarios and questioning Sonny&rsquo;s loyalty. Darren had done his best to defend his friend without openly opposing Randall Junior. In the end, he agreed to tap Sonny&rsquo;s phones and stay in town just in case.</p>
<p>A week went by with no more news, and Darren had let himself hope it would all blow over. Then last Tuesday Randall Junior had called to tell him fresh evidence now showed that Jack Starr may actually be alive. Darren could hear the primal rage in Randall&rsquo;s voice as he yelled into the phone. &ldquo;Agent Horne, you stay on my son like a flea on a dog&rsquo;s ass until I tell you otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Things have been all downhill since that call, he mused. Late that same evening, Sonny had driven to the farm and had nearly lost Darren, who was still hiding his car when Sonny drove back out. Sonny drove to the outskirts of Watertown, New York, where he&rsquo;d convinced the local to stay open 20 minutes later than normal. Darren had followed until Sonny stopped for gasoline on his way back to the farm. He took the opportunity to pass Sonny and get to the farm first.</p>
<p>When Sonny arrived at the front entrance to the manor house in both inside carrying asingle brown book and leaving his car door open behind him. Inside on the front seat, Darren found a 2-inch stack of freshly copied pages. Each page showing the clear outline of a smaller book&rsquo;s page with handwritten lines and drawings. The sound of Sonny&rsquo;s footsteps on the stairs had given Darren enough warning to hide without being seen, but he didn&rsquo;t follow Sonny.</p>
<p>Darren returned to his car and called Randall Junior, who listen to his story, and told him to wait where he was. 30 minutes later Randall Senior arrived by helicopter, landing on the large flagstone turnaround blades dangerously close to the fountain.</p>
<p>Randall Sr.’s motions were deliberate and slow but conveyed nothing of frailty or weakness otherwise. After he lowered himself from the helicopter, he motioned Darren to follow him toward the manor house and proceeded directly upstairs. On the third floor, feeling a little embarrassed at breathing heavier than the ancient man that led the way, Darren followed him into a comfortable study lined with books.</p>
<p>Before Darren&rsquo;s eyes could even adjust to the dim light, Randall had opened a secret door in the bookcase and stepped into a bright room spilling yellow light. A moment later he returned holding a medium-sized leather book. &ldquo;Is this what you saw?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It could be. I mean it was dark, and I was trying not to be seen, but it was roughly that shape and color.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Randall pushed the book into his hand. &ldquo;And the copied pages, did they look like these?&rdquo; He asked, flipping the book open for Darren to read. There was no mistaking the neat handwritten lines and flipping forward and back. He noticed several of the drawings he&rsquo;d seen in the copies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, this is what he copied. I only got a minute to look at them but I recognize some of those drawings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Horne,&rdquo; he choked out in a voice like sandpaper. &ldquo;Go back to your assignment, Junior will be in touch soon.&rdquo; Darren never met Randall Sr. before that night, and he could still remember the sense of awe he felt staring into those ancient eyes. The interaction had left him invigorated with his mind racing over previously unthought-of possibilities. In the morning he&rsquo;d found his way to the hospital and began scouting for a good place from which to watch Sonny&rsquo;s every move.</p>
<p>Randall Junior had indeed contacted him that next day. He claimed proof of their suspicions could come at any moment. His instructions had been crystal clear. If Aimee showed up with Jack, he was to eliminate both of them, then subdue and detain Sonny.</p>
<p>Watching them through the binoculars, Darren repeated a litany of hope, don&rsquo;t let Jack be here, don&rsquo;t let Jack be here. So deep in concentration was he that the site of the white car pulling up to the loading dock took him by surprise. He should&rsquo;ve heard it start, or at least noted the sound of the engine as it drove underneath his perch.</p>
<p>A tall lanky blonde-haired man Darren recognized as Farouq&rsquo;s assistant got out of the car and handed the keys to Sonny. The tall man disappeared inside of the loading dock as to other people appeared coming out. Dr. Blackwell nodded once to Sonny and Aimee before turning and shaking Jack Starr&rsquo;s hand. With a wave, she turned and retreated inside the building.</p>
<p>The three remaining figures had moved to the side of the car and with a moment of dread, Darren realized that his own car was the better part of a mile in from the West Pavilion. Jack and Aimee were leaving in that car, and if Darren had any hopes of fulfilling his mission, he needed to run.</p>
<p>With his lungs already burning and sweat dripping into his eyes, Darren reached the top of the hill, where the gate stood open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn,&rdquo; he swore as he pulled the gate shut and clicked the padlock closed on the hasp. &ldquo;That should buy me a couple of minutes,&rdquo; he told himself as he ran down the walkway toward the main parking lot. The time Darren got into the car and turned it on, drenched and feeling lightheaded as he gulped for air and raced for the only intersection that led from the north service dock.</p>
<p>He was still gulping air when Randall senior answered the phone, &ldquo;this had better be important, I don&rsquo;t normally take calls on my direct line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Jack, he&rsquo;s here with Aimee and Sonny, but they&rsquo;re all together. If I engage them now, I can&rsquo;t guarantee Sonny won&rsquo;t get hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slow down son, and take a breath. You sound like you&rsquo;re suffocating. Where are you, where are they and why do you think Sonny might be with them now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right, sorry.&rdquo; He forced himself to slow his breathing and continued, &ldquo;they caught me off guard I found Sonny and Aimee near the abandoned north entrance and while I was watching Farouq&rsquo;s assistant brought the car around for them. Blackwell brought Jack to the car, and I realized they were about to leave, so I ran back to my car and I am on my way to head them off. I locked the gate at the top of the drive so I figure I have 2 to 3 minutes tops. I don&rsquo;t know if Sonny&rsquo;s in the car or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agent Horne, at this point we can only hope that my grandson is smarter than that. If he isn&rsquo;t…&rdquo; Darren was afraid to say anything for fear of what was coming next. &ldquo;Junior said he let you keep that Russian RPG, do you have it on you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>What a heartless bastard. He doesn&rsquo;t even care if his grandson gets killed. Fuck me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one gets out of the car. Do it before they make it somewhere public, understood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The line went dead, and Daren crammed the phone back onto its cradle with a grunt. Boom pop-pop. The car lurched forward out of the long right turn and straight for the runoff ditch that ran along the road. With a desperate heave, he jerked the wheel back into the corner, feeling the car respond. It didn&rsquo;t last. With a horrible keening screech of steel on asphalt, the car plowed over the shoulder to hit the embankment to throw him into the steering wheel.</p>
<p>With no air in his lungs, Darren&rsquo;s head swam, making it hard to grip the door handle. It fell open with a creak before accelerating to bounce twice shaking the car. As he lowered himself into the ditch, he mused about not using a seatbelt. Back on the roadway, Darren explored the pain in his ribs to check for breaks. Only bruising. Satisfied, he scanned the area to get his bearings.</p>
<p>An engine spooled up, approaching from the far side of the corner. The back end of his car crouched at the top of the embankment, forcing Darren to take a knee to open the trunk below and half crawl into it to retrieve the case. Still wincing with pain, he ran toward the sound of the engine, now slowing down. Case banging with every labored stride, Darren rounded the corner in time to see the white Ford pulling right onto the road ahead from the service entrance road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Argh!&rdquo; Darren bellowed, throwing the case onto the road in front of him and pouncing on it to rip it open. He pulled out the long beige tube and fitted it with the rocket-shaped missile before standing. The car almost a hundred feet away and Darren sucked a quick breath to hold while sighting. This would be an easy shot. He didn&rsquo;t even need to calculate the lead. It was going straight.</p>
<p>Crack! His ear exploded with an impact that flashed everything white and bounced his head off of the launcher tube. Woosh! The rocket grenade took flight. With horror, Darren realized he was aiming at the ground not more than a dozen yards ahead. Still dazed, he desperately tried to throw himself to the ground, but he watched the rocket fly away in slow motion as he staggered on his feet.</p>
<p>A massive fist, accompanied by a wave of heat and sound, tossed him through the air like a plaything. On his back, staring at the trees, Darren tried to remember the landing. It was peaceful, the tall pines waving in a breeze that wasn&rsquo;t present on the ground. He was spinning, the open strip of the sky turning above. Somehow, the trees nearest his feet were getting closer.</p>
<p>The perfect silence gave way to intense ringing. Darren&rsquo;s stomach heaved as the ring turned to a roar. As he rolled to the side to discharge the bile in his mouth, the sight of his leg in the air registered as odd. The ground was sliding as he expelled the last of the bitter liquid. He watched the wet globule moving away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! Who are you, where are you taking me,&rdquo; Darren croaked at the blurry shape dragging him by his ankle. The figure remained silent. Asphalt gave way to gravel and the man in the suit dropped his foot without ceremony and continued up the hill without him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Darren rolled over onto his hands and knees to follow the stranger. Still blinking hard to clear his vision, Darren&rsquo;s arms shook as he pushed himself up. On one knee, he stopped to catch his breath. He couldn&rsquo;t find the man anywhere. A black sedan appeared, driving away a dozen yards from where Darren knelt.</p>
<p>Who the hell was that? I know him from somewhere, that walk.</p>
<p>Darren was still kneeling on the side of the road when the ambulance arrived, a New York State trooper following close behind. Men piled out in the road. The trooper approached with his gun out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hands up where I can see them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I can do that officer, I&rsquo;m kinda stuck here,&rdquo; Darren said, trying to sound calmer than he was. &ldquo;In my back pocket is my badge, I&rsquo;m ATF, Darren Horne. I need some help here if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a nod from the Stater Trooper, the paramedics moved over and knelt in front of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His ears are bleeding,&rdquo; one said to the other. &ldquo;Sir, can you tell me what happened here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo; He answered truthfully. &ldquo;Someone was here. I think he dragged me to the side of the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sirens filled the air again as the state trooper removed Darren&rsquo;s ID. The embankment across the road shimmered with flames. He watched them spread, everything still muted. &ldquo;Looks good,&rdquo; said the trooper while handing back the leather badge case.</p>
<p>Firetrucks were on the scene now. When had that happened? How did I get here? Why can&rsquo;t I focus? The paramedics were lifting him by his armpits, walking him toward the back of the ambulance. With every step, he seemed to regain some composure and the dizziness faded incrementally. He spent several minutes answering questions from both the paramedic and one of the state troopers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three fingers&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was wearing a dark suit, but I couldn&rsquo;t see his face&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a little when I breathe too deeply&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the time they finished questioning him, Darren had recovered enough to stand up. The paramedic objected, but Darren pushed him aside bodily. &ldquo;I need that car back up on the road,&rdquo; he called out to the state trooper, who was walking away. &ldquo;I need it now. I was in pursuit of some rather dangerous individuals and every minute that I&rsquo;m not trying to find them is a minute I don&rsquo;t have to spare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trooper eyed him warily and then looked at the car with its back bumper just a foot higher than the road. &ldquo;Okay, we got some tow straps in the back. It doesn&rsquo;t look that bad we probably won&rsquo;t need another car. Should have you out and about 10 minutes. But it looks like both your front tires are blown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shit!&rdquo; The world seemed darker, and the pain closed in, making it hard to breathe.
&ldquo;Hey, take it easy. You can take the spare from our car. Same make, you gotta love government issue.&rdquo; He rested a hand on Darren&rsquo;s upper arm. &ldquo;We all got to stick together. Just come find me when yos&rsquo;re done.&rdquo; He pushed a business card into Darren&rsquo;t hand.
There was nothing to do except wait and try not to grind his teeth in frustration as the fog slowly cleared from his thoughts. Someone had been following him, and he played right into an ambush. But who?</p>
