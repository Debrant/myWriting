<h1>Chapter 31</h1>

<br><br>
<p>Nick was staring at him, a crooked smile playing on his lips. “What you on about,” Holland asked.</p>
<p>“Nothing,  I was just wishing there was some way to get to you right away.” He  replied. Nick’s gaze had lost focus, and he was staring at something  only he could see.</p>
<p>“When you mean right away?”</p>
<p>“I mean, we  fucked this timeline. I have to go back. With everything we’ve learned  about the Parra family and their motivations you know they won’t give  up, ever. When I go back, it’ll be December 2 again last year. I wish  there was a way I could get to you before the Order could confirm the  relic exists.”</p>
<p>All and thought about everything they’d uncovered  over the last four hours and nodded. “That could be useful and there may  be a way.” He studied the room, knowing there was surveillance  equipment somewhere that they hadn’t been able to find. He stepped into  the hall and motioned Nick to follow him.</p>
<p>Holland  followed Nick outside the lab and asked, “what’s up?”</p>
<p>Holland  leaned in close, voice low. “Why make it easy for them?” Nick seemed to  get the drift leaned into the wall as close as was comfortable. Holland  continued, “on December 2 I was in Baltimore before being deployed to  Yreka California. Well, Montague actually, but there was nowhere to stay  there so the entire team ended up renting rooms at the Mountain View  Inn in Yreka. We were there for two weeks, Nick. Heck, if you could get  there fast I was up alone in my room drinking coffee and reviewing case  notes from 630 until 930 because the team was working late and we didn’t  meet until 10.”</p>
<p>“All I have to do is get you to clasp my hands  while we hold a magic rock. So what can I say to you that would get you  to trust me and do that?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think that will be as hard as  you might imagine.” With the understanding that Nick could review these  moments later in detail, Holland talked rapid-fire. He began with his  parents’ names in history, coming from Africa to his brothers and  sisters, and finally to a few tidbits that Holland had never told anyone  about his time overseas before. Nick sat and listened as Holland came  to a close. “And the icing on the cake would be showing me the relic. I  can remember pacing back-and-forth that first day holding a drawing of  the dam thing and wondering if any of it was real.”</p>
<p>“If you think  that’ll work and you’re okay with me roping you in. Carter, I think of  you as a friend. I could use your help, but if you think you would be  happier without all this, just tell me.”</p>
<p>Holland reached up to  place a hand on Nick’s shoulder. “with everything we’ve learned, I would  have to be a fool to work for these people anymore. And Nick, I think  of you as a friend as well. Come find…”</p>
<p>“Holland?” A voice boomed  from down the hall, “Carter Holland, what the hell? Randall told me  you’d died in a car crash. Were they lying to me or did you trick them?”  Holland turned to watch Sonny strolling up the hall, carrying three  large pizzas in his right hand and looking a little disheveled.</p>
<p>“I   like to think that they believed it. You could call the trick, but I  call it survival. That friend of years, Darren Horne, is one mean  bastard.”</p>
<p>A sour look passed over Sonny’s face. “You’re not lying  about that.” He stopped for a moment and look from Nick to Holland and  then with a smile hefted the pizza and said, “well it’s a good thing I  brought three. Come on, I’m hungry, you guys can fill me in all the  details while we eat.” He turned and walked into the lab, placing the  pizzas in between the stacks of paper on the long table.</p>
<p>Holland  shared a look with Nick, who shrugged and said, “I’m hungry too.” He  followed Sonny into the lab and straight to the pizza boxes. “First  things first,” Nick said to Sonny in an overly serious tone. Sonny  paused while opening the box before Nick continued, “what kind of pies  did you bring?” He finished in a lighthearted tone.</p>
<p>No one talked  much for the next several minutes until there were only two slices of  pizza left and the four of them were leaning back in their chairs  contentedly. Holland looked from Farouk to Sonny and wiped his mouth. “I  understand that you’ve been more than helpful recently and we have you  to thank for these copies of the journal. If you don’t mind my asking,  why the change of heart?”</p>
<p>Sonny looked at Farouk and then at Nick.  Holland could see the tension between the two men hadn’t evaporated  entirely, but Nick gave a nod and Sonny answered. “Honestly, when my dad  asked me to kill Jack, it all unraveled for me. I remember feeling like  I was talking to a stranger suddenly. Then when they had me call you to  the farm, I couldn’t shake that feeling, that I didn’t know my family,  for anything. Mostly it was Aimee, though. She helps me see what was  going on. Nick and Blackwell helped, too. Carter, I’m sorry, I’m not  sure what else to say.”</p>
<p>Holland studied Sonny. He seemed earnest,  sad. “Water under the bridge. I’m just glad you came around.” To his  surprise, Sonny seemed overwhelmed with emotion. His eyes watered and  his cheeks flushed as he looked down and bobbed his head several times.  But Nick must’ve seen something in Sonny’s behavior that he missed  because sat up straight and then leaned forward.</p>
<p>“Sonny,” Nick said, adding bass to his voice. Sonny looked up at Nick. “Sonny, where is Aimee now?”</p>
<p>His  watery eyes sprung tears as he clamped his job shut, grinding his  teeth. “They took her, sorry.” He was sobbing now, and Nick moved over  to stand in front of him.</p>
<p>Holland was standing now as well, a  chill spreading down his spine. Nick was lifting Sonny from the chair.  “what are you sorry about,” he asked.</p>
<p>“I didn’t have a choice, I  was just supposed to keep you busy.” He looked at the clock on the wall  and Holland followed his gaze. 11:50. “They’ll be here any minute,”  Sonny concluded.</p>
<p>Nick grasped Sonny by the shoulders in both hands  and gave him a gentle shake. “You’re one of us now, Pera, aren’t you?”  Sonny nodded weakly. “I haven’t told you this before, but every time we  come to a major obstacle and I seem to predict what’s happening, it’s  because I have already lived this timeline, and I do. I want you to  listen to me, Sonny. Aimee is your anchor. There have been a few times  where things don’t work out with you two and you are such an asshole  without her. So let’s go get her back.”</p>
<p>Sonny’s head snapped up. “what? Like the three of us?” He asked while looking back and forth between Holland and Nick.</p>
<p>Holland  chimed in, “yes the three of us. Ahmed, you need to get out of here,  now. Go find Dr. Blackwell and let her know what’s happening, but be  careful. If you see anyone you don’t recognize, hide.”
Farouk  nodded and stood up. “Okay.” He said simply. He began to leave but  hesitated to turn back to face Nick. “What do you think happens to all  the people on the timelines you leave behind?”</p>
<p>Nick stood up to  face him. “I have only speculations. I haven’t let myself think too far  past learning how to control this thing. There’s a lot of math that’s  going to come in the next 60 years that nudges me toward a multi-verse  theory. It’s hard to reconcile how this thing is even possible, but when  I find out, I will come and find you, my friend.” The two men embraced  and then Ahmed was gone, his footsteps fading down the hall until even  the echoes disappeared.</p>
<p>Holland cleared his throat. “Ahem. Okay, Pera, what was the plan and how do we get the upper hand?”</p>
<p>Sonny  looked at the clock again. “The plan was for me to take the relic and  sneak out before midnight. If that didn’t work I’m supposed to sit and  wait while a strike team moves in, I’m not supposed to reveal myself  until the last minute.” Looking at the clock again he added, “which is  in seven minutes guys if we’re going to do this, we going to have to  figure the rest out on the move.”</p>
<p>“How will the team enter the  building,” Holland asked while the three of them gathered their things.  Nick pocketed the relic before moving to the chalkboards, where he  erased them furiously.</p>
<p>“A single five-man team will come through  the service entrance, they will disable elevators and head straight for  the fifth floor.”</p>
<p>The plan sounded weak and Holland realized Sonny  was either lying or he didn’t know everything. “Nick, there’s no time.  We have to assume another team’s going to block us from the rest of the  hospital.” He watched Sonny out of the corner of his eye for any  reaction. A slow blink in the smallest of handshakes negated most of his  concerns about collusion. “I think our best option is to get to the  roof and drop onto the Skyway. The ground slopes up, so worst-case we  jump for, but if we can find a way into the hospital, then we try to  blend in, make our way downstairs and get out. Now, let’s move out.”</p>
<p>The  clock read 10:55 with the thin red secondhand ticking past the six  already. Holland ran down the hallway at a trot, stopping in front of  the stairwell doors to listen as he cracked it open. “Let’s go,  quietly,” he said, motioning them up the stairs.</p>
<p>Boom! They all  paused steps before the landing of the sixth floor at the sound of the  steel doors slamming open below. The stomp-stomp came the sound of  pounding feet, the group below was moving fast. Holland grimaced and  motioned vigorously up the stairs. Still moving cautiously, they paused  at the door to the roof. Holland cocked his head to the side with a  finger up, waiting for the sound of the door below.</p>
<p>Clang! The  exit bar slammed the door open below in the stomping feet, all but  disappeared. In Holland’s mind, he could see the strike team moving down  the hall with practice heel-toe rolling steps. Cha-chunk. The door  below closed, and Holland cautiously pushed open their own door, letting  Nick in Sonny move out onto the roof first.</p>
<p>Only the stairwell  protruded higher than the graveled tar surface below them. Holland moved  to his knees and then his belly as he slid to the edge overlooking the  skywalk. Nick and Sonny both followed suit, both of them matching his  study at the far end.</p>
<p>“There are at least two men at the end of  the bridge,” Holland told them. “It looks like they’re waiting to  ambush. I don’t think we’ll be able to slip down without them seeing and  they are definitely going to notice if we break the glass.” Moments  from committing himself to the path below, the door behind them swung  open. Holland rolled onto his back, pulling his pistol and pointing it  over his feet in time to catch the surprised look of the man there.</p>
<p>Dressed  in black from head to toe and with a large caliber scoped rifle slung  across his back, the man was clearly a sharpshooter. Thankfully, nobody  had foreseen this contingency in his momentary shock left him  vulnerable.</p>
<p>“Don’t even breathe hard,” Holland told him over the  unwavering pistol pointed directly at the man’s head. “Sonny, secure  that weapon.” Pera was up and behind the man in a flash, lifting the  rifle over her shoulders and tossing it to the ground while pushing him  against the wall. A quick patent frisk revealed two tactical knives and a  9 mm sidearm. All went into the pile. Sonny removed the man’s earpiece  for sliding an arm around his chin, pressing his head forward while  squeezing.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” Holland called out, but he knew  it was the right call. There had been no restraints in the man’s gear.  It was kill, or incapacitate, nothing else makes sense. Sonny dragged  the now limp body to the edge and rolled over the 5-foot drop onto the  roof of the skywalk.</p>
<p>“That should buy us a couple of minutes at  least.” He looked directly into Holland’s eyes. “all the way back down  before they notice?”</p>
<p>Holland nodded and was about to tell Nick to  arm himself, but realized he already had. “I’m no good with these,” Nick  said, holding out the rifle. “I know the theory but I have never  practiced, should I throw it over?”</p>
<p>Holland took the rifle and  slung it out over his back. At the top of the stairs, he paused before  opening the door. “Weapons ready, we do this as fast as possible, but  without sounding like a herd of elephants.” Both men nodded, Holland  opened the door and the three of them rushed the steps. Every footfall  made Holland flinch, even though the sound wasn’t likely to travel past  the thick metal doors at every landing.</p>
<p>On the ground floor, they  turned right away from the kitchens, making their way toward the loading  dock. A bright line of light spread several inches into the darkened  room ahead of them from underneath the exit door. Grim certainty that  another team waited outside those doors in full-ready formation settled a  crossed Holland’s shoulders like a familiar backpack.</p>
<p>“We’re  trapped. They brought a hell of a lot more than a single team, Sonny.”  He was watching his body again, his consciousness drifting back and up  slightly behind them. It was always amazing how calm he sounded in these  situations. It was talking again, “you to get on either side of the  roll-up door,” he watched his body move 10 feet back from the large  garage-style door on sling the rifle and lay prone, “when you’re in  position, open the door about halfway.”</p>
<p>Holland stared at the  concrete floor as the bright beams of light poured into the room from  rows of floodlights outside. He waited for his eyes to adjust and then  looked out. At the far side of the dock, tucked into the left and right  corners, sat two tripods, each with three large floodlights aiming in  toward the dock.</p>
<p>“Come on out, this isn’t going to end well unless  you throw your weapons through the door and come out with your hands  up.” Even amplified over a megaphone, Holland recognized the hollow  sandpaper of Randall Senior’s voice.</p>
<p>Sonny mouthed, “fuck,” with exaggeration.</p>
<p>“Can you guys get a safe shot on those lights,” Holland asked in a loud whisper.</p>
<p>Sonny moved away from the opening and farther to the right, kneeling down and aiming across the opening at the lefthand tower of lights. Pop, the gun jerked, and Holland’s ears rang. Pop Pop, the light changed.</p>
<p>“It’s not out. Must be ballistic glass and I only have one backup clip. What do you?..”</p>
<p>Sonny didn’t get the chance to finish the question. The room exploded in light with an ear-piercing Bang! Holland couldn’t see anything, and the ringing had grown to a wail, drowning everything else out. He rolled hard to the right, holding the rifle out in front, and clamped his eyes shut. He hit the wall with a thud he felt through the silence.</p>
<p>With the wall as a reference, Holland drew his 9mm, dropping the rifle back into the sling. He aimed straight down the wall, then rotated 30 degrees to aim out the door and squeezed the trigger in two bursts, adjusting the angle in between. Pop-Pop… Pop-Pop.</p>
<p>His hearing returning enough to hear the shots and a muffled shout, followed by the clamor of someone diving for cover. He opened his eyes, relieved to find the lights still on. That had been a mistake on their part. Holland turned his back on the doors, pausing long enough to make out the shadows stretching into space behind, and then ran back toward the kitchens as fast as possible.</p>
<p>Past the loading area and one hundred feet down the hall, Holland dove to the floor and turned to face the space he’d abandoned. “Nick, Sonny, fall back. I’m ready to cover,” he bellowed, swinging the rifle in front of his eye. From this distance, the light wasn’t so blinding, and a silhouette stood out immediately.</p>
<p>Boooom! The rifle punched his shoulder, and his ears went deaf again. The lights cut out within a few heartbeats, and as sound returned to his world, he heard the slap-slap-slap of someone running down the hall. “Who’s there,” he called out, sighting toward the sound.</p>
<p>“Don’t shoot, it&rsquo;s us,” Sonny called back. “That was quick work back there. You saved our asses,” he panted, sliding next to Holland.</p>
<p>“Where’s Nick?”</p>
<p>“I thought he was with was with you, he was gone by the time I could see anything.”</p>
<p>Holland scanned the hall, remembering the layout ahead. “He probably took the stairs. Put your head down and close your eyes until you hear something. Another flash-bang is their best bet now.”</p>
<p>Randall’s voice floated to them, eerily soft over the megaphone. “Hold your fire, everyone. I need the boy alive at all costs.” Minutes passed with only the sound of their breath as he and Sonny waited.</p>
<p>Five shots rang out in rapid succession, ta-ta-ta-ta-ta, from somewhere in the building. Seconds later, three more ta-ta-ta followed by a whomping that moved the air. Holland concentrated into the silence and picked out multiple radio beeps. “That must be Nick, I think Randall is making everybody check-in. Now would be a good time to move,” Holland whispered. He lunged upward and ran for the direction of gunshots, dropping the rifle once more to bounce at his back. He yanked the 9mm P226 free and pulled open the door to the stairwell.</p>
<p>Inside, the smell of cordite hung thin, mixing with the metallic scent of blood. “Nick,” Holland barked into the darkness. Behind him, Sonny pressed himself flat against the other side of the door.</p>
<p>“Yeah, second floor. I have one team pinned down up there. Randall told them not to kill me, and I don’t think they know what to do. One of their guys tried to toss another flashbang down here and I popped him before he could toss it. If it’s the same group, we saw earlier, there’s only two of them left, I think. You&rsquo;re the expert Holland, what do we do now?”</p>
<p>Before he could answer, Randall’s voice bellowed, filling the hallways with echoes. “Enough of this. Bring me the girl. Bring me, Aimee Delgado!”</p>
<p>“Shit,” Holland heard Nick mutter above. Holland wheeled around to catch Sonny’s arm before he could rush outside.</p>
<p>“Don’t,” he commanded with a tug. “He wants you to react.”</p>
<p>“Nooo!” A woman’s scream rang out, followed by sobbing amplified over the megaphone. “Sonny, I just crushed the bones in her hands,” Randall’s voice cooed. Sonny wrenched his arm free, his face going slack. Their eyes met, Holland stared into an abyss of panic.</p>
<p>“Sonny,” he began, but Randall’s continued shrieking drowned him out.</p>
<p>“I only need two that have been initiated to take the stone from him, and I have Dr. Farouk here already, gentlemen. There are two more teams at the top of the stair ready to smoke out Starr. Sonny, you have 5 seconds to get on board or I’m going to strangle this woman.”</p>
<p>Sonny’s eye twitched and his jaw snapped shut with a clank. Bang! Holland ducked, looking for the nearby shooter, and fell face first as pain seared through his hip and into his groin. Too late, he realized Sonny’s gun was smoking. With a feeble lift, he tried to turn and aim, but knew there wasn’t any time. Gravity rewarded the effort, striking his cheek with the floor, but he didn’t feel it. He was out of his body, watching it writhe in pain. Sonny rolled the body over. He saw the tears in the younger man’s eyes as the barrel moved.</p>
<p>I’m sorry, momma.</p>
