<h1>Chapter 9</h1>

<br><br>
<p>Holland sat down in what had become his favorite chair. He opened his folder of notes and prepared to go over the last two weeks. Winter rain crackled against the narrow window at the end of the table. He stared into the grey morning then pried his attention away and onto work. Holland pulled out the first paper-clipped bundle of files. There was nothing useful in the wiretap transcripts at first glance. He took a deep breath and removed a yellow highlighter pen from the case.</p>
<p>Starting over at the beginning he began highlighting. It didn&rsquo;t take long to highlight every interaction Nicholas had with his family. His interactions tended to be brief, only his father, Jack had less, recorded time. Which wasn&rsquo;t saying much. Three days after placing the bug Jack had announced that he was leaving. He had told Jane away from the boys. Jack must have packed his things before telling his children. He left the apartment for the last time only moments after telling them.
Holland finished and flipped to the beginning of the notes. He read again, focusing only on the highlighted portions. He stopped at a conversation between Nick and his mother. It was the day after Jack had left them.</p>
<p>Nick: mom, you have a minute?</p>
<p>Jane: what is it, sweetie?</p>
<p>Nick: you know you don&rsquo;t have to be strong.</p>
<p>Jane: what are you talking about?</p>
<p>Nick: mom you never let yourself show emotion. Negative emotions, I mean. You never let us know what&rsquo;s bothering you.</p>
<p>Jane: that&rsquo;s not true, I don&rsquo;t want to talk about this.</p>
<p>Nick: do you remember when you were taking abnormal psychology?</p>
<p>Jane: maybe, I&rsquo;m not sure, why?</p>
<p>Nick: you were telling me about your coursework, about repressive personality types?
Jane: yeah.
Jane: what are you getting at?</p>
<p>Nick: mom that&rsquo;s you. You keep everything bottled up so tight that it eats you up inside. J
ane: that&rsquo;s not true.</p>
<p>Nick: yes it is mom. You know it is.</p>
<p>Jane: what is this about?</p>
<p>Nick: it&rsquo;s about you and it&rsquo;s about dad leaving. It&rsquo;s about you not trying to act like everything&rsquo;s okay to protect us.</p>
<p>Nick: Dad&rsquo;s an ass hole.</p>
<p>Jane: Nick!</p>
<p>Nick: but, he will grow up one day and Saul and I will have our own relationships with him based on what comes next. And that&rsquo;s good, that&rsquo;s healthy. That&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s supposed to be.</p>
<p>Nick: But you need to let yourself be mad at him, that&rsquo;s also healthy. We need to see that example.</p>
<p>Jane: (inaudible).
Nick: Especially Saul, you know how he is. How he emulates everything masculine and he tries so hard to get dad&rsquo;s approval. You need to let him see your emotional process. You need to be mad! You to work past it and eventually if you get there, he needs to know that you can forgive his father. Because you will. Mom you&rsquo;re going to be stronger because of this. He was holding you down, not the other way around.</p>
<p>Jane: wow, Nick, oh wow. (Sobs)</p>
<p>Nick: I know that was a lot, are you okay?
Jane: yes (laughs) I mean no. But thank you. When did you get so grown up?</p>
<p>Nick: that&rsquo;s hard to explain, but let&rsquo;s say I live in my head and think about everything. I see everything.</p>
<p>Nick: Mom I love you, you are going to be okay, I know it. But you need to talk to Saul I&rsquo;m pretty sure he can&rsquo;t be without your help.
Holland thought back to his own teen years. He had been the youngest of five children. His father, much older than his mother, died at work of a heart attack. The old man had worked 35 years as a beat cop in Baltimore. It was the height of the civil rights movement. His older siblings were gone and on their own, in college, protesting, marching. At 12 he and his 16-year-old sister were the only two at home with his mom.
One day his older brother Leonard ended up on the wrong side of a protest raid. The very policemen that had attended dad&rsquo;s funeral beat him and took him to jail. Mama had been inconsolable for most of the night. Holland had tried to comfort her in much the same way Nick had. Although at 12 he didn&rsquo;t have the vocabulary or understanding. But he sensed a camaraderie of spirit in their quiet resolve and the way in which they watched the world. There was more here, he pushed the transcriptions off to the side. He flipped through the folder until he found what he was looking for and pulled up to the front.
On an 8.5 x 14&quot; yellow legal pad he had compiled every detail that he&rsquo;d been able to learn about the relic.</p>
<p>Every suspected possession of the relic coincided with great wealth. The individuals believed to have wielded it demonstrated were all of import. Leaders, generals, or influential business people. There was nothing to suggest prescience of any type. The current theories of senior members suggested otherwise. They believed that the relic, or relics, were objects that intensified the will. They were like children arguing over the wishes of the lamp.</p>
<p>He looked at his watch, 45 minutes until the restaurant across the street opened. It was Saturday and he knew Nick would be working. It was time to draw the boy out. They had engaged in light conversation on both of Holland&rsquo;s previous visits. He felt confident that he could make an excuse to start an in-depth conversation.
He mulled over his options for a few minutes before putting away the transcripts. He took out his notes from agent Pera and began reading through those next. Pera had done well and managed to get Jack access to the ARPANET through the telephone somehow. Sonny had put Jack through a series of pointless exercises to test the man&rsquo;s capabilities. All of which Jack completed without any issues. Within a week. Pera had Jack pulling real Intel from semi-secure government databases. He was speeding that Intel back to headquarters and they were pleased with the results.
Holland suspected that Sonny and Jack were meeting in the evenings. Pera&rsquo;s behavior had become erratic. Most mornings he had a tired and disheveled look.He also knew more than a few influential people wanted Sonny brought into the inner circle. Holland wasn&rsquo;t confident that he was up to the task of blocking Pera&rsquo;s entry. Even if he was using operation funds to party with an asset.
Holland stood up to stretch. He wandered out of the conference room through the dark hallways and into the cafeteria. The kitchen wasn&rsquo;t open on the weekends, but the self-serve coffee station was. He poured himself a mug before pacing back to the conference room, lost in thought.
He took a swig of the hot liquid and moved to the phone to dial headquarters. He let it ring twice and hung up to wait for the return call.
&ldquo;Holland here. I need to speak with Farouk.&rdquo; He could hear the sound of typing over the line and then the line was ringing again.
&ldquo;Vif if Criphtof, ahem, excuse me.&rdquo; The wet sound of open-mouthed chewing then an audible gulping of some liquid. &ldquo;Sorry, this is Christoph, Dr. Farouk is out right now. What can I do for you?&rdquo;
Christoph this is Carter Holland, I&rsquo;m in the field out in Portland, Oregon. How are we doing when the relic? I need a rundown of everything that you&rsquo;ve discovered since it arrived on site.&quot;
&ldquo;Oh, okay, yeah I see your clearance here. Give me a minute.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Mr. Holland?&rdquo; The voice asked, returning several minutes later, &ldquo;are you still with me?.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, proceed.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Okay then, our little lump of charcoal is non-periodic to start with.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Wait, are you implying that it&rsquo;s of alien origin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, only that the energy spectrum doesn&rsquo;t match up with any periodic elements that we know of.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Why is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sir is a very good question. But one I cannot answer. Moving on, the object has no discernible reaction to hot or cold. No reaction to laser or particle bombardment. We have learned that when handled, the device emits a very short burst of gamma radiation. This happens even if wearing protective equipment. It has been difficult to analyze, &lsquo;cause we can barely measure it. But it appears that each burst is an identical nonrepeating series of energy spikes.&rdquo;
&ldquo;identical and nonrepeating, can you clarify?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, identical in that the same sequence of spikes appear every time the object is first touched. Nonrepeating, meaning that the series itself is one structured bust, unique. The one thing we are all in agreement on is that somebody made this thing.&rdquo;
&ldquo;So you do think it&rsquo;s alien.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farouk has expressly forbidden us from saying that, but it is a possibility that&rsquo;s on&hellip;.&rdquo; Christoph stopped midsentence and Holland could hear someone else&rsquo;s voice in the background. A moment later he could hear the hard thump and rustle of a handoff.
&ldquo;Christoph, go take a break.&rdquo; Pause, &ldquo;Carter, you there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s me, Ahmed, what&rsquo;s going on back there?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know for sure, but tensions are high. Leadership wants results that I can&rsquo;t give them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christian indicated that we have a device of unknown origin. A device, as opposed to a magic rock, passed down for generations. Does that about sum it up?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Carter, that about sums it up. Listen, be careful out there. Do you remember McClintock? He&rsquo;s working in signals now. Anyway, he has this theory that the device sends out a handshake protocol. Yesterday he gave a pretty long-winded explanation to the brass. The gamma bursts is like a modem signal he told them. Modems use bursts of sound to send data over phone lines. He thinks the device is communicating like that using gamma. But he didn&rsquo;t stop there. He says the signal is only meant for one person. The brass ate it up and now they think that person is your guy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silence stretched between them for a long minute until Ahmed spoke again. &ldquo;Look, Carter, you&rsquo;re the best field agent we have if you ask me. Now, you did hear this from me and if you repeat it I will deny it. But there is a lot of talk upstairs about Pera right now and grumblings that you&rsquo;re moving too slow. Just be careful, and don&rsquo;t do anything stupid if they try to bring the kid in. Okay?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say I didn&rsquo;t see this coming. About Pera, not the relic. Do you have any suggestions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do actually. Get your person of interest tested, I will send you a list of tests and locations that might work out for you. If you can rule them out, then do so. If not at least you&rsquo;ll be out ahead of it.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good man Ahmed, thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holland set the receiver down with a click and stood up to pace the room. He threw on his heavy down parka and made his way downstairs. Outside it was still raining hard enough that Holland had to put his hood up as he crossed the street. He arrived at the restaurant a few minutes after it opened and was the only person in the dining room when he sat down.
The space was dim but warm, the smells of saffron and spice filled the air. Everywhere brown, red, and gold tapestries, paintings, and Persian art hung on the walls. White linen-covered tables with small votive candles lit in the centers.</p>
<p>The couple that owned this restaurant was arguing in hushed tones from the kitchen so he sat himself. Holland suppressed a grin when Nick approached the table with a glass of water and a server&rsquo;s apron on. &ldquo;Welcome back,&rdquo; he greeted as he set the water glass on the table. Are you getting the Koubideh platter again or would you like something else?&quot;
&ldquo;Am I that predictable? Are there any specials?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but I can check if you would like. Have you tried the lemon chicken? If you haven&rsquo;t you should. We marinate it in yogurt with saffron, garlic, and lemon, it&rsquo;s delicious.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t tried it yet, I&rsquo;m sorry what did you say your name was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Nick and you&rsquo;re Mr. Carter, right? I&rsquo;ve heard you talking to Ali the last few times you were here.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Carter is my first name actually, it&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s nice to meet you, Nick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Likewise. Carter, you&rsquo;re becoming a regular here so help yourself to some lentil soup, lunch will be out soon.&rdquo;
Things were looking up. He made his way over to get a bowl of soup and stuck his head around the opening to the kitchen. Ali and Banu were still pantomiming at each other, voices lowered. Holland could see that Nicholas was starting his lunch over at the grill. He waved his arm to get Nick&rsquo;s attention and when he arrived asked, &ldquo;could I get some warm pita bread to go with this?&rdquo; Indicating his soup.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be out in a minute.&rdquo; He turned to go then, stopped, &ldquo;Hey I forgot to ask you if you wanted anything to drink? Everybody&rsquo;s supposed to get a cup of Persian tea with their meal if they want it. I can get you something from the bar if you&rsquo;d rather, let me know. I&rsquo;ll be right out.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Tea would be good, thanks, Nick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man turned away to place two long bright yellow skewers of meat onto the grill. Holland took his soup back to the table where Nick appeared like a magician with warm pita and hot tea. &ldquo;For the gentlemen,&rdquo; he intoned with a mock bow. Holland opened his mouth to speak but Nick was marching back to the kitchen.
Holland mopped the last of the soup up with pita, the warmth and turmeric eased his tension. The smell of roasting garlic and onion reached him as he wiped his mouth. Nick was there again placing a plate in front of him. The meal wasn&rsquo;t a masterpiece, but it was a work of art. Jasmine rice washed gold with saffron under bright yellow morsels of chicken. The charred chicken&rsquo;s perfect grill marks matched the surrounding grilled vegetables.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nick this looks amazing. Have you been cooking long?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yeah, feels like forever. But I love it, it relaxes me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good. It is nice to have places to retreat to. So are you in college?&rdquo;
&ldquo;No, high school. Are you a teacher or a fed?&rdquo; Holland almost choked at the question but managed to sound calm when responding. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s an odd question, what makes you think it is one of the two?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a very formal way of speaking and those are our two biggest client bases. There is an FBI office across the street. On this side of the street around the corner is the teacher&rsquo;s credit union. Upstairs in this building is the teachers union itself. So call it a deductive assumption. Anyway, enjoy your meal, I&rsquo;ll come check on you in a bit.&rdquo;
Holland pondered the young man as he ate.</p>
<p>He isn&rsquo;t like any 14-year-old I have ever met. Observant and articulate? Who cooks to relax?  Old people.  There isn&rsquo;t a hint of reproach or wavering of eye contact, not normal, especially for a white kid. But does it have to be the relic? If it was, could all this be the result of a single touch? Magic rocks, who would have thought? And what does this get me? Nothing, all I have are hunches and Sonny is getting results.
Man, I didn&rsquo;t see this coming, but they could be right about all of it.</p>
<p>Disappointed he finished the meal and pulled the notepad from his pocket to jot a few thoughts down. He was putting it back into his pocket when Banu came over to the table. &ldquo;Mr. Carter, how was your lunch, did Nicky take care of you?&rdquo; She smiled with pride at his answer of affirmation and waved Nick back over to clear the table.
Other guests began to trickle in. When it was apparent that Nick would not be returning, Holland settled the bill and left. He had to get in front of things. Pera was on a dangerous trajectory. One that uncorrected could be the ruin of the Starr family.</p>
<p>Back in front of his files staring out the window again, Holland dialed Sonny&rsquo;s pager. He entered 1182 and hung up to return to the files.
Sometime later, Holland was enjoying his 3rd cup of coffee. The door to the conference room opened and Sonny let himself in. He looked rested, with a spring in his step and a small smirk on his face.
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t know you were down here today,&rdquo; he offered. &ldquo;I got your message to come, what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to take action Pera,&rdquo; he closed his files and stood up to face the other man. &ldquo;I have been on the phone with headquarters and over to see young Mr. Starr today.&rdquo;
Holland made his way out of the conference room heading down toward the kitchens. He did not wait to see if the other man kept up while he kept talking. &ldquo;Dr. Farouk has sent me an updated list of assessments. Physical tests that we can administer to determine if our kid had contact. Now that they&rsquo;ve had a chance to analyze the relic, they feel confident about what to look for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He washed the mug in the sink, dried it with a towel, and placed it back in the little cupboard next to the coffee station. The skin between Pera&rsquo;s eyebrows wrinkled with concern, Holland continued. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to jeopardize your progress with Starr but I have a plan. A pretty flawless solution to our needs, actually.&rdquo;
Holland was fast walking back to the conference room at the far end of the building and Pera had to jog-step to catch up. &ldquo;We need to give Jack Starr his security clearance. Nothing too flashy classified maybe. In the process though we&rsquo;re going to put him through all of the tests that we want to perform on Nicholas. This will give us a baseline. Plus we can justify it and our future actions in one swoop. We imply how impressed headquarters has been with Jack&rsquo;s skills and abilities. Tell him that they want to build a profile for future recruitment based on the results of his tests. Later we tell him that the agency is interested in whether these types of traits are inherited. So my question to you Pera is, do you think that Jack Starr would submit his son to this type of testing? Given that we presented it in this fashion?&rdquo;
A storm of emotion passed over Pera&rsquo;s features until settling into a grimace. He pulled out a chair and sat down with his elbows on the table. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; The word looked like it tasted bad in Pera&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<p>Holland felt a little ashamed at the momentary glee he experienced seeing it. &ldquo;Good, it&rsquo;s settled then.&rdquo; He tore several sheets of paper from the out-feed of the printer and placed them in front of Pera. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the list of tests that we will need to perform.&rdquo;
Sonny read the list, half mumbling to himself, &ldquo;bloodwork, motor control, IQ? Reaction speed, cognitive stress tests. What&rsquo;s computed tomography?&rdquo;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like an x-ray, but more complicated. You have probably seen some of the new cross-sections like images. The ones that show a single slice of the entire body? Those are computed tomography imaging slides. The doctors call them CT scans. Better still, there happens to be one such available here at the hospital University.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know Portland State had a medical school.&rdquo;
&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s Oregon Health and Sciences University, a teaching hospital. We will need to give headquarters 72 hours&rsquo; notice. But when we are ready they&rsquo;ll send out one of our own techs to come and run the scan.&rdquo; Holland sat down on the edge of the table looking out the window.</p>
<p>Pera was silent for a long moment before speaking. &ldquo;Jack will do it, he won&rsquo;t even blink. Hell, he&rsquo;ll probably be excited to participate. And when the time comes, he&rsquo;ll be right there to help strap Nick in.&rdquo;</p>
