<h1>Chapter 26</h1>

<br><br>
<p>Aimee watched as Andres intercepted Jack by gather move into a one-arm walking hug. The way her cousin anticipated her need for privacy made her smile. Although in Jack&rsquo;s defense, he seemed to get along well with the boys now that they had eliminated the pressure of trying to keep up with them. Jack threw one forlorn look over his shoulder as Andres hustled him down the path away from the cemetery. Despite Jack&rsquo;s unimpressive physical coordination, he was still a big man and Andres had his arm at full extension to reach across Jack&rsquo;s back and hold his shoulder.</p>
<p>Aimee made her way between the stacks of white marble with their arrangements of colorful flowers. A few dozen feet further down the path brought her to the first of her family mausoleums. Her parents' tomb, as always, stood out. It still looked so new, its pristine white walls several shades brighter than its nearest neighbors. Inside, she placed a single bright sunflower on her father&rsquo;s casket and a vase of freshly-cut hibiscus on her mother&rsquo;s before kneeling in front of the small altar in the back. After a small prayer, she crossed herself and spoke to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mom, Dad, I miss you both so much. I&rsquo;ve been away for far too long and now I need your help. The world is too small and everything is closing in on me. That job I took, the one you would&rsquo;ve told me to be careful about, it turns out you were right. Old money has its own agenda. My work impresses everyone and just got promoted. Recently I started dating someone and it&rsquo;s complicating things. You wouldn&rsquo;t approve of him, he comes from money. Everything in his world is so different from ours. His biggest struggle in life is living up to his grandfather&rsquo;s image.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s good in him underneath the bravado. I didn&rsquo;t see it at first, not until he got hurt. Behind all the scheming and the push and pull of his family is a kind person. Sony, that&rsquo;s his name, is Carter Holland&rsquo;s junior partner, and it was Holland&rsquo;s idea to give him a chance. I&rsquo;m here now because he followed his heart, against his family&rsquo;s wishes, to save his friend Jack. So here I am, babysitting one pot of milk for another. Those two, they couldn&rsquo;t be more different. Sonny is deliberate and disciplined. Jack fancies himself smart enough to figure out anything on the fly, which makes him lazy. Somehow these two became friends while Sonny was using Jack as an informant and now he&rsquo;s risking everything by trusting me to keep him safe and out of sight. And me? I&rsquo;m like you, dad, always trying to be the hero. They are both broken and wounded, which is why I want to save them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These men are such children, both of them, more machismo than sense. The thing is, I suspect something has happened to Carter and I don&rsquo;t know if I can trust Sonny to make the right decisions without help. But if I go behind his back to get him help, he may see it as a betrayal. I don&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;d do if that happened. Most likely he&rsquo;d make all the wrong decisions and run straight back to his family, which just might get him killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you were here. You would know what to do. You probably would have talked me out of all this. I wouldn&rsquo;t be hiding, and worried about being found out by the company I work for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sat in silence for a long time until the unmoving air became oppressive. Inside her bag, she found the two tall glass candles which she placed on the altar after wiping the dust away. With a smile, she lit the candles and said her goodbyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to go make things right. I will try to come home soon, goodbye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aimee made her way into town, stopping at the only payphone within a mile. The phone kiosk protruded from the east wall of the two-story tienda near the corner. With the sun an hour past midday, a line of shade clung to the wall, which would cut the heat to tolerable. She picked up the phone and dialed Sonny&rsquo;s pager, and then walked into the store to get something to drink.</p>
<p>In the shade of the doorway, she took a long sip from her Coca-Cola and waited for the phone to ring. She didn&rsquo;t wait long in her stomach did a little somersault as she lifted the receiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello? Sonny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aimee, where are you? Is everything okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s fine. I&rsquo;ve been away too long and need to get back to work before people ask questions. But, I was calling to see how everything was going back there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things are tense here since I took over for Holland. Nick is working with me, but Dr. Farouk doesn&rsquo;t trust me. I guess he blames me for Holland&rsquo;s death, I wasâ€¦&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, what? Holland is dead? When, how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a long silence. She could hear him breathing. The excitement she felt a moment before turned to disappointment and fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sonny, tell me you didn&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do it, it was Horne. Randall Junior had me call Holland to tell him to meet him at the farm to pick up Jack because I had to run an errand for the Council. I didn&rsquo;t know they were going to kill him. Darren&rsquo;s a hard ass, but taking out Holland? I&rsquo;m still shocked it went down that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scene played out in front of her, but she pushed the despair down deep before it took root. She should&rsquo;ve seen it coming, but now was not the time to worry about that. Of course, they would want a cover story for Jack&rsquo;s absence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re saying that Jack died with Holland?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody can sneak anything past you, can they?&rdquo; He sounded relieved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do now? If you can&rsquo;t get the results Randall Senior wants, what will he make you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sonny had to be guided, and she needed to get a handle on this right away. Now that the shock of the punch in the stomach was receding, her mind raced ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do. Nick showed me how to use the device, but it will only work if he shows someone. I tried to show Randall Senior, and nothing happened. I did it just like Nick showed me, but nothing happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need someone else there that you can go to.&rdquo; The idea of sending him to confide in Blackwell gave her the chills. The doctor was as smart as they came, but hers was a raw intellectual calculus. People didn&rsquo;t seem to occupy permanency in her mind the way they should. It was one of the consistent truths Aimee had realized throughout her life.</p>
<p>Intelligence had to be nurtured because without compassion and empathy, it was hard and uncompromising. Sonny wasn&rsquo;t replying, and she guessed he was spiraling out of control. His anxieties and self-doubts would be ruining his sleep, causing a snowball effect on his ability to self-manage.</p>
<p>Perhaps she was wrong about the doctor, but even if she wasn&rsquo;t, it was still the best option. &ldquo;Sonny, would you consider talking to Dr. Blackwell about any of this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sounded panicked now. &ldquo;Why on earth would I do that? If Randall Senior found out I was working with her, he would try to wring my neck on the spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, don&rsquo;t be dramatic, besides you need a fresh perspective on this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not being dramatic,&rdquo; he cut her off. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know him like I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That had been the wrong approach, but Sonny needed a quick reality check. &ldquo;Your friend,&rdquo; she emphasized, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t stay here forever. Civilians without training always end up in trouble, when they stay in hiding too long. What you think is going to happen when Randall Senior finds out you lied? Sonny, you need to build your alliances now and Dr. Blackwell can help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was silent again on the other end. She seized the chance to push the issue. &ldquo;Her version of the order differs from the one you told me your family taught you. Maybe that&rsquo;s what you need. Everything you&rsquo;ve told me, everything you&rsquo;ve hinted at, has led me to believe that you want out from underneath their shadow. Plus, if anyone can convince Dr. Farouk to get on board it&rsquo;s her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, you might be right. But I&rsquo;m not sure my grandfather is that far off. The deeper into this thing I get, the more I don&rsquo;t understand. And then there&rsquo;s Nick, if I were religious I would swear he was the fucking devil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sonny! That&rsquo;s not funny,&rdquo; he chuckled on the other side of the phone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, I don&rsquo;t mean to laugh. My cousin used to say that not funny, Sonny,&rdquo; as he mimicked a child&rsquo;s tone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only half-joking, though. The kid gives me the creeps. It&rsquo;s like he knows everything. Given what I&rsquo;ve seen the relic do now, I mean what if it is the reason Nick&rsquo;s a 15-year-old intellectual monster that goes toe to toe with our top scientist and a ninja-level ass-kicker? Imagine what it could do for someone with the money, power, and experience of Randall Pera Senior. I mean, the kid barely touched it for a moment last winter and then he evaded us for half a year? Nick didn&rsquo;t even know anything about it, while grandfather has an entire book explaining how the thing works.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Sonny, you told me Randal is a psychopath. Do you really want him wielding that kind of power?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The side of her face tingled with the static electricity filling the silence this time. &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. So what we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Start with sharing your concerns about Dr. Farouk with Blackwell. If it goes well transition to sharing some of your worries about what happened to Holland and see where that takes you. The goal is for you to tell her what you just told me about the relic. Then, and if you judge it safe, get her to help you find someplace for Jack. Preferably a path back home that doesn&rsquo;t get you in trouble. Sonny, don&rsquo;t play Dr. Blackwell, she&rsquo;s too smart for that. Either tell her the truth or tell her you don&rsquo;t know if you can trust her yet and see where that takes you, got it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got it.&rdquo; She heard his ragged breath before he swallowed. &ldquo;So, getting Jack back home would be good, but getting you back with me would be better. I&rsquo;m so lost. I never expected that it could all be real. And I don&rsquo;t trust Blackwell, no matter how smart she is. I need you to meet and speak with Nick. I need you to see what I&rsquo;ve seen so you can explain it to me. When can I call you again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call me in the morning, before sunrise tomorrow. Be careful Sonny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aimee dug in her pocket for another handful of quarters while finishing her coke. The coins were warm and damp in her hand as she slid them into the machine. After dialing the necessary numbers, she asked herself where she and Sonny were headed while she waited for the phone. He was falling in love with her, or rather, he already had. Part of her wanted to trust that he had nothing to do with Holland&rsquo;s murder, but she couldn&rsquo;t shake the feeling that he hadn&rsquo;t tried to stop it either. Sonny had been pretty clear about the way his family talked about getting what they want. His not knowing what they planned didn&rsquo;t seem to fit the picture he painted himself.</p>
<p>The phone rang, startling her out of her retrospective. She picked up the receiver. &ldquo;Hello? This is Aimee Delgado field analyst support level one, is this Dr. Blackwell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh good, Carter&rsquo;s other pet project. The first one worked out so well for him, after all. What can I do for you analyst?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard about Holland, is it true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you sleeping with Sonny Pera? Do you really expect me to give you information over the phone for you to feedback to that pack of jackals?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wow, this is going well. Maybe she&rsquo;s not as smart as I thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carter told me you two were working together. Surely he told you we were as well. Me getting close to Sonny was his idea, mostly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a momentary pause before Blackwell responded in a tone that was a notch less hostile. &ldquo;Yes, Holland is dead, although Dr. Farouk says we cannot be sure. The body was burned beyond any comprehensive conclusion. Farouk is of the opinion that Darren Horne was under orders to remove Holland, but doesn&rsquo;t believe that they would kill him outright, which makes little sense to me. So why have you called?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want it to be true either, but Sonny just told me it was an ambush. Carter believed in Sonny, and I&rsquo;ve gotten to know him over the last several months. He is not like the rest of his family, but I think I might lose him to them without help. Look, he&rsquo;s intimidated by Nicholas Starr and he&rsquo;s being seduced by the relic&rsquo;s power. Right now, though, he&rsquo;s more scared of his grandfather than anything else. We just ended a phone call where I tried to convince him to come to you for help. Are you somewhere that is safe to talk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have Christian sweep my office twice a week for listening devices and cameras. It&rsquo;s as safe as I&rsquo;m likely to get access to. Now, what&rsquo;s on your mind, Ms. Delgado?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack Starr is alive and if you can help Sonny get him back home safe and without exposing everything he just might be your man on the inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aimee imagined Dr. Blackwell sitting up straight in her chair as the phone made a sound like fabric being pulled over a microphone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call me Cynthia, it&rsquo;s Aimee, right? Let&rsquo;s start at the beginning, you have my undivided attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her cousin&rsquo;s place was quiet when she showed up with a basket full of fresh produce. The sun was just peaking over the horizon, stretching its long fingers across the island. She let herself, heading straight for the kitchen. From the basket, she set out two small bunches of plantains, some eggs, chili peppers, onions, and bacon. She hummed to herself as she cooked, excited at the prospect of ending this affair. If she was honest with herself, she was excited to see Sonny as well, although she still wasn&rsquo;t sure how she felt about him.</p>
<p>However, she felt about him. Their time together wasn&rsquo;t boring, and she&rsquo;d been spending too much time with Jack. His incessant flirtation was exhausting and only an itsy-bit flattering. Even if he wasn&rsquo;t as smart as he thought, he was still an able conversationalist, picking up on nuances and concepts in a way that Sonny couldn&rsquo;t. Jack wanted constant attention in a way that Sonny didn&rsquo;t. He needed to influence her. Which was infuriating when he did. Somehow, although contrived and transparent, he could always get her to open up. She would find herself mid flirt and clamp down on it before it could carry on any further. There was always that glimmer in his eye, that &ldquo;I got you&rdquo; look. She would be glad to send him on his way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey good morning, what time is it?&rdquo; Jack asked as he stumbled into the living area, bleary-eyed and half-dressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s early. Go get washed up and put on some clothes.&rdquo; He had been angling himself to highlight his manhood, and the look of disappointment at her response forced her to turn away for a quiet chuckle.</p>
<p>Honestly, boys are so dumb.</p>
<p>Jack returned a few minutes later. &ldquo;Geez, it&rsquo;s only 7 AM, a little early for breakfast, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have some exciting news that couldn&rsquo;t wait sit down.&rdquo; Aimee put out two plates with crispy bacon, scrambled eggs, and sweet tostones before sitting down across from him.</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s eyebrows lifted as he picked up and bit into one of the fried plantain cakes. &ldquo;Mmm, what are these?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those are tostones, but I used sugar, chilis, and allspice because I know you have a sweet tooth. Most of the time we make them with garlic and salt, but my mother used to make them this way when I was a kid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they&rsquo;re fantastic. So what&rsquo;s the exciting news?&rdquo; He asked around a mouthful of food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may have found your best bet for getting home sooner than expected,&rdquo; she told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, okay. How so?&rdquo; He tried to sound upbeat but couldn&rsquo;t hide the disappointment in his voice. With a flash, she realized he hoped that the two of them would get together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I have been working out the details of three problems over the last week. I should&rsquo;ve already gone back to work and there&rsquo;s no way I can delay anymore. That&rsquo;s problem number one. Problem number two is that your son is still being held at our testing facility in New York. The last thing I was trying to figure out is how to get you back home, because while I know you like it here now, as soon as I&rsquo;m gone I think you&rsquo;ll either get into trouble or get bored.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack had a very expressive face. He would&rsquo;ve been a terrible poker player. Aimee watched as a series of emotions played out like a one-man skit on his canvas. Concern, followed by amusement, moving into worry and ending in embarrassment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, you&rsquo;re probably right,&rdquo; he admitted, surprising her with his honesty. &ldquo;So what have you come up with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As of this morning, I have just arranged amnesty for you to visit the same testing facility where Nick is being held right now. I believe you&rsquo;ve met Dr. Blackwell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s lip quivered as it pulled into a grimace. &ldquo;Yes, I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Dr. Blackwell is in charge of operations at the facility in question, and she has agreed to allow you a visit with Nicholas if you will submit to another interview. If everything goes well, she thinks she will clear you of the trouble in New Orleans and put you off limits with the Order. How does that sound?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you trust her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Blackwell&rsquo;s interest in you is entirely political. What you&rsquo;ve been through and what you&rsquo;ve witnessed during your time with Sonny will give her leverage to improve her position on the Council. I don&rsquo;t need to trust her, I trust myself. She has no other plausible motive for using you. The games of power these people play Jack are fleeting. Once your secrets are on the table, seeking retribution against you would be foolhardy. By giving you an avenue to go public, so to speak, inside the Order, she is putting the Pera family in a position that would make it unwise for them to acknowledge your existence ever again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If a grown man could emulate a puppy, Jack did so now. &ldquo;So when would this happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This weekend, it&rsquo;ll give you time to say goodbye. Eat your breakfast, it&rsquo;s getting cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took a bite, chewing in a slow and methodical manner of never breaking eye contact. &ldquo;Will I see you again afterward,&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Sometimes it seemed like all men were delusional when you got right down to it. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine you wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; leading him on might save lives.</p>
<p>His eyes left hers, and a slow grin spread around his chewing. &ldquo;Good, this weekend then.&rdquo;</p>
