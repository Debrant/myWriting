<h1>Chapter 5</h1>

<br><br>
<p>Nick woke to the sound of howling wind. The cabin creaked and flexed like an old boat on the water. He rolled over to look at the glowing red digits of the clock on the nightstand. 5:22, shifting to lay on his back toying with the idea of returning to sleep.
A few lazy stretches later Nick tossed the blankets aside and sprung out of bed. After taking a moment to dress he stepped into the hall. Both of the dogs were sitting facing the door.
The shepherd was whining softly. Pumpkin turned around to greet him, the little dog prancing a little circle until he picked her up.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a storm,&rdquo; nick soothed the worried animal stroking its head. Pepper barked once, rising into a ready stance as the door opened to admit a small avalanche of snow. Jeannie stepped inside and turned to force the door shut behind her. She had a lean into it hard.
&ldquo;Wow, looks bad out there, is everything OK?&rdquo;
She gave a little start, &ldquo;oh, I didn&rsquo;t see you there.&rdquo; She was removing several layers of coats and hats, &ldquo;had to fire up the jenny and check on the horses. Danny is in the garage. He&rsquo;s moving in the car and the three-wheeler.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Do you need any help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we&rsquo;re okey-dokey. This kind of thing happens, we do live on the side of a mountain ya know. Get a couple of these every year. You boys won&rsquo;t get to go on your little outing though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The previous evening came back to him in a mix of disappointment and relief. Nick wandered into the dining room and flopped into one of the chairs. Pumpkin nestled and licked at his hand until he resumed his petting. Jeannie meandered past into the kitchen and poured a cup of coffee. Nick stared at the little pot with a sudden longing bubbling to the surface.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I get a cup?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is a good idea dear? Do you usually drink this stuff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have, and besides, I already missed any real opportunity to stunt my growth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They both burst out laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here you go then.&rdquo; She handed him her mug, cream, and sugar?&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No thank you,&rdquo; nick to the tentative sip of the scalding liquid and grimaced. It was bitter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Actually, on second thought, yes cream and sugar please.&rdquo;
Danny came in letting another cold front into the room. Nick sat stirring even more sugar into the cup, amazed at how good the sweetness was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t look good for a recon today.&rdquo; The relief on Danny&rsquo;s face was evident and reflected Nick&rsquo;s own.</p>
<p>What am I not remembering? And why are we both so relieved not to go look for this? Whatever this is.
The storm eased off from blizzard conditions by noon and then to a light dusting by early evening. Jeannie left to take the dogs out as the phone rang. The loud metallic bell making Nick jump.</p>
<p>Gods, how long has it been since I heard a landline ring?</p>
<p>Danny took the call.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Avery rez, what can I do ya for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, sweetie,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No we are OK, we&rsquo;re used to the snow up here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s been great.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yeah I guess that could work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know if it&rsquo;s about the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no. I didn&rsquo;t mean it that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to talk to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK, I&rsquo;ll tell him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jane, Jane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a hell-of-a kid, you should be proud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love you too. Goodbye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick could feel the tears welling up in his eyes and was thankful that Danny pretended not to notice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mother&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wants me to take a greyhound.&rdquo; It was a statement. The hurt and the shame of that bus ride felt like yesterday. A single fat tear rolled down his cheek.</p>
<hr>
<p>By morning the skies were clear and the sun was shining. Everything was covered in a thick white blanket of snow. The land was silent, which suited Nick fine. He slogged through the shin-high powder to the garage, taking the snow shovel.</p>
<p>He cleared the driveway, the path to the stables, and the area around the porch. He was sweating despite the chill air. It wasn&rsquo;t silent anymore. The air was full of the sounds of a wilderness coming back to life.</p>
<p>Trees moaned and creaked, protesting the weighing down of their branches. A tip-tap-tap played a constant drumbeat as the ice and snow melted. Occasionally accented with a woosh or a splash as branches shook off their burdens.</p>
<p>The effort of work had cleared his mind and dampened his melancholy. The thought of returning to his teen life left him feeling shaken and ill every time he considered it.</p>
<p>His father&rsquo;s drunken outbursts. The hours-long fights his parents would have. He and his brother retreating into any safe place they could find. The sobbing apologies dad would offer on mornings after. High school.</p>
<p>Gods! High school was bad enough the first time!</p>
<p>Nick often wondered what made so many people glorify the high school experience. He could only remember a handful of people from that time. How he could reintegrate into freshman year halfway through without blowing everything. The beginning of that year was a blur. He could only remember four teachers and perhaps two of his peers that weren&rsquo;t inside his circle of friends.</p>
<p>Hanging up the shovel he stared long and hard at the little red Honda three-wheeler. The keys were in the ignition. He threw open the roll-up door and jogged back to the cabin.
&ldquo;Pepper, Pumpkin,&rdquo; he hollered from the dor. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna take the dogs out one last time,&rdquo; he declared into the empty space. He scooped up Pumpkin and trotted back to the garage. He nested the Schnauzer into her basket that Danny had attached to the back of the ATV. Once she was safe in her blankets he wheeled the bike out and closed the garage.</p>
<p>The Honda came to life with a gurgle and sputtered to a stop. He struggled with the choke for a few minutes until he finally got the little engine started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pepper come!&rdquo; he hollered back to the dog as he took off up the drive. The Aussie dog kept up with ease. Eyes wide and tongue lolling with every graceful stride. Nick took the main road, already plowed, to the far side of the neighbor&rsquo;s property. He turned down a little dirt road that ran down the entire length of the orchard.</p>
<p>Nick&rsquo;s stomach lurched and his heart was pounding with a mix of anxiety and excitement. The ATV felt dangerous as it fishtailed at every bump and curve. Ahead of him, the little weathered shed marked the end of the orchard road.</p>
<p>He slowed as the road gave way to forest. The oversized tires threw lazy snowballs as they churned through the untouched blanket covering the forest floor. At a few hundred yards in, he slowed down looking for the ridge or any other visible sign of his previous track.</p>
<p>Pepper ran forward turning around to bark at him from fifty feet further on. For lack of a better option, Nick followed the dog. She paused for a heartbeat before racing through the trees without hesitation. He bobbed and weaved like a boxer is the branches struck out from every angle. Zip. Slap Pop.</p>
<p>Nick eased off the throttle as a 6-foot embankment came in to view. He didn&rsquo;t need to follow the dog as he turned toward the ridge of birch trees that ran up to the slope.</p>
<p>The little engine chugged to a stop at the top of a little valley. He was sure this was the same one but was confused by what he was seeing. He swung his leg over the seat and paused looking down at the center of the dell. Pepper came to lean against his thigh. A low keening whine issued from the dog as she sat staring up at him.</p>
<p>The ground below was bisected with deep tire tracks. The raw brown earth showing in dark parallel lines. Pepper shot down the slope, her nose leading the way. Nick watched the dog zigzag around the ravine.</p>
<p>What the hell is this?</p>
<p>He moved to one of the tracks kneeling to get a closer look.</p>
<p>These are too direct, too parallel with each other to be a redneck outing. military?</p>
<p>He did a circuit around the perimeter counting three sets of tracks. The two smaller ones looked like standard off-road tires.</p>
<p>A jeep maybe, or maybe one of those old Ford Broncos that sheriff&rsquo;s and park rangers use.</p>
<p>The tracks came in from the southwest to cross in a straight line west to east. Then turned to retreat the way they came. The biggest set curved around the center of the bowl. Pepper was busy digging and barking around the perimeter of a square patch of turned earth. From his vantage point near the top, it looked like the beginning of a sizable vegetable garden.</p>
<p>He jogged down to join the dog and found that the ground wasn&rsquo;t turned but had been excavated. The top 10 or so inches of soil were missing. Nick did a double-take and counted his step around the border. Almost five paces on a side. Nick guessed that each would measure out to an even 15 feet.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a couple of hundred cubic feet at least. Where the hell is all the dirt?</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least it makes sense to you,&rdquo; he remarked to the dog. She continued bouncing and rolling through the fresh dirt. &ldquo;Hey get out of there or you&rsquo;re going to earn yourself a bath.&rdquo; He received a dirty look and a whine for the comment.</p>
<p>Nick blew out a long breath. He turned to walk back up the hill when he noticed Pumpkin running down the hill toward him. &ldquo;Oh, I forgot about you, I suppose you want to roll around in the dirt too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ride back was lethargic. Nickolas&rsquo;s mind wandered without guidance. The mystery of the scene he left behind him sat with him. Despite that and the disappointment of unanswered questions, he felt good. Sitting tall in the seat, he let his eyes roam the forest landscape, taking it all in with a smile.</p>
<p>The sun was near its zenith and created prisms in millions of snowflakes. The effect was blinding, but magical. The hum of the engine was unobtrusive when moving at this speed. In the quiet, he caught sight of several rabbits and a fox along the way. Pepper too, seemed content, not bothering even to bark at the fox.</p>
<p>He brought the Honda to a stop near the middle of the orchard. Then getting Pumpkin from the basket took several gliding steps into the interior. There was a music to the moment. It was his and his alone. Somehow he would find the reason for this cosmic replay. That there was a reason, a cause, he was sure of. For the time being, however, it was enough to be here.
He placed Pumpkin on the ground, letting the dogs roam to their enjoyment. Turning and looking up until the sunshine covered his entire face then Nick closed his eyes. He breathed with intention.</p>
<p>In, two, three, four, five.
Hold, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen.</p>
<p>Out, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
In, two, three&hellip;
The world stopped around him. He breathed, beginning from the 5-15-10 rhythm. Moving every few minutes deeper into his center to end at 15,45,30. At ninety seconds per breath cycle, his heart was a deep slow beat of the universe.</p>
<p>Thump &hellip;thump</p>
<p>Thump &hellip;thump</p>
<p>Thump &hellip;thump</p>
<p>Nick opened his eyes and the drumbeat of his heart retreated from awareness. Pumpkin waited on the ground under the ATV as close to the engine as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry girl, come on you can finish the ride back in my coat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten minutes later he pulled into the driveway to see a green and white Ford Bronco parked at the cabin. &ldquo;Jackson County Sheriff,&rdquo; emblazoned on the door circling the seven-pointed star. Nick drove the Honda into the barn, taking time to turn off the fuel line before leaving.</p>
<p>On the way by he stopped to examine the tires on the truck. The vehicle looked recently washed. Nick found himself longing for his smartphone.</p>
<p>It would be nice to have a pocket-sized high rez camera right now. But I don&rsquo;t miss the damn thing otherwise.</p>
<p>It proved impossible to slip into the cabin without notice. Both dogs began dancing and barking as soon as they saw the dark-haired man inside.</p>
<p>They clearly know him, so there&rsquo;s no reason to think the connection is me just yet. Act natural.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello sir, I&rsquo;m Nickolas, Danny is my grand&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hells bells and little green fishes Nick, we don&rsquo;t have to tell everyone how old I am. Anyway, this is C.W. Smith our sheriff as of last year&rsquo;s election, congrats by the way. C.W.&rsquo;s good people Nick.&rdquo; Danny forced eye contact with an almost imperceptible nod.</p>
<p>C.W. was an inch or two taller than Nick. The man appeared friendly. Though he looked like he would use every inch of his large frame to his advantage if backed into a corner. The sheriff looked Italian or part Native American. Nick guessed that he passed for a white man in 1984 though.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nick, nice to meet you, son, Danny and I go back a ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that firm handshake and easy smile, he knows how to put people at ease. Smooth. Seems authentic enough. Kind of reminds me of a big Dean Martin. Goofy, in a you should get to know me kind of way. I kinda like this guy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Danny, Jeanie, thanks for your time now. I still have three of your neighbors to notify.&rdquo; He moved around Nick toward the door glancing down. &ldquo;We heard the three-wheeler coming down the drive. Mind if I ask where you were coming from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick glanced down at the snow and bits of mud on his shoes and decided to see where this was going. &quot; Took the Honda out past the orchard and down along the side of the mountain for a bit.&quot;
Sheriff Smith took another deliberate look down at the dirty boots. When he looked back up he lifted his eyebrows and gave a small frown. &ldquo;You stop for lunch somewhere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No sir. Did get out and wander around the orchard for a minute. Oh, and I found someone&rsquo;s future plant site way out in the middle of nowhere. I thought it looked like a vegetable garden. Could be that they&rsquo;re about to plant marijuana.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sheriff looked at Nick and pursed his lips while pantomiming an affirming nod. &ldquo;Right, well like I said, Danny, call the office if you hear anything.&rdquo; He let himself out, turning to give a final smile as closed the door.</p>
<p>When the sounds of tires on gravel receded to nothing, Danny let out a breath. &ldquo;I have known C.W. for a good while now and that was not like him. At all.&rdquo; Danny paced into the kitchen and turned around walking back to the entryway. &ldquo;He might as well have said, Danny, there is some weird shit going on.&rdquo; Back to the kitchen. Back to the door. &ldquo;We need to put you on that bus.&rdquo; He started walking away again, but Jeanie stopped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh for heaven&rsquo;s sake, will you just sit down already!&rdquo; She snapped, &ldquo;Now, will somebody fill me in, please? What does Nick have to do with a manhunt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat down with a harumph. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any manhunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeanie walked over to sit next to Danny on the couch. &ldquo;You too mister, park it,&rdquo; she aimed at Nick. &quot; You two have been acting funny since yesterday. It&rsquo;s time to spill the beans.&quot;</p>
<p>Nick made his way to the dinner table and pulled a chair out, placing it in front of the TV across from them. He sat down, straddling the chair and resting his forearms on the low back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may have stumbled onto something when I took the dogs out back when I got here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember, I went to find the lunchbox you lent him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, I remember. So what&rsquo;s with the somber looks and Hardy Boys' routine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;C.W. told us they were looking for an escaped convict and to call if we saw anything out of the ordinary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danny paused to wait for Jeanie to catch up. &ldquo;Come on hun what have we not heard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you talking about, we haven&rsquo;t heard anything,&rdquo; her eyes shot open under her lifted brow. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t heard anything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something else,&rdquo; Dany continued. &ldquo;C.W. seemed pretty interested in where Nick had been. And Nick let us know that someone has been digging nice, neat square sections of earth. Both a nice cover and a nice tell by the way,&rdquo; he nodded at Nick. &ldquo;Anyway, when C.W. didn&rsquo;t comment on a possible marijuana field, he was letting us know that he knew about it already. The sheriff is not the kind of guy to lie, so that means he&rsquo;s under orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hell&rsquo;s bells Danny, who could do that, Feds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, what was it?&rdquo; She asked turning to Nick.</p>
<p>He arched an eyebrow, &ldquo;hmm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said you found something, what was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dunno, but Danny saw it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They turned as one to Danny, eyes expectant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say. Whatever it was, it wasn&rsquo;t natural. Looking at it made me..&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake get to the point you old fart. What was it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear. I said I can&rsquo;t say, and I mean that literally. It looked a bit like a lump of charcoal. Actually, I thought that it was at first, it was sitting in the middle of what looked like a makeshift campfire. But it caught my eye because it was too symmetrical. Then when I got down there to take a look and suddenly I felt like I was in the crosshairs of a sniper. I was too scared to touch the damn thing. I buried it, used my boot to&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn it, the boots and the ATV., C.W. wasn&rsquo;t here by chance. He knew I had been there&rdquo; Danny stood up and began pacing again. &ldquo;Nick, get your things son, you have a bus to catch.&rdquo;</p>
