<h1>Chapter 20</h1>

<br><br>
<p>Sonny sat staring at the gilded double doors of rich black walnut positioned not quite behind the reception area. Outside of the elevators, the room opened into hallways on both sides, running the length of the building. The seating area itself consisted of three large couches with four matching leather armchairs. Brass accented the deep brown furniture and formed three sides of a square, the open end facing a long wooden paneled countertop.</p>
<p>Standing behind the counter, a young man appeared to be reviewing documents and taking notes. An hour ago he had greeted Sonny, &ldquo;Welcome, Initiate Pera, my name is Dylan. Please make yourself comfortable, I have informed the Council of your arrival. He had no choice but to wait and reflect, his thoughts drifting to the Order of the Founders.</p>
<p>The Order had evolved with American independence to help shape the birth of the country. Sonny&rsquo;s family could trace participation at the highest levels going back to its formation. It had grown from the ashes of several &ldquo;secret societies&rdquo; and upon arriving in America had set out to recruit wealthy and influential families to their cause. His family had helped build the Order and prided themselves on shaping world events for three centuries.</p>
<p>Expectations were high in the Pera family, and Sonny had struggled to live up to the family name his entire life. In every aspect of his life other than athletics, his performance had been average, and average was not something the Pera family accepted. Today, with luck, that would all change. His heart was aflutter with a secret hope that he would be the one to take Holland down. That hope had forced him out of bed this morning.</p>
<p>He could still feel the way the room swam as he&rsquo;d pushed himself upright. He had to hold on to the wall until the dizziness had passed. The knee to the head in Las Vegas had done more than give him a concussion. It had cast adrift him on the endless ocean. His world pitched and writhed like a boat on high seas. Nicholas Starr would get his next, but first Holland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Pera, the council will see you now,&rdquo; Dylan announced, standing with his hand folded in front of his all-white suit. Sonny couldn&rsquo;t understand why the Founders insisted on traditions that made them look like a cult from the outside. The Council of Ascendants was stuck in a past where secret societies clung to the shadows. They didn&rsquo;t understand the power of the media, but that was something that he would rectify when he ascended.</p>
<p>To reach that highest rank, a Founder must achieve a terminal position inside of the organization they choose to infiltrate. Among the council were some of the most influential persons in the world, from senators and CEOs to presidents and dictators. In a world where the United Nations met, the Founders should cast off their disguises and declare themselves. It was all about imaging now. The world wanted heroes to believe in. With the right messaging, he knew, they would embrace the Founders as the saviors of humanity.</p>
<p>Dylan held open the ornate wooden doors with a small bow to allow him entrance. The room inside was a replica of the Founders headquarters from the early 18th century in which the American Revolution first took root. Brass and lacquered wood vied for attention with the smell of teak oil and old paper. The massive table cut from a single bole of wood dominated the room. Reportedly carved in 1758 for the Ascendant Council in Philadelphia and later recovered to restored here, it radiated importance.</p>
<p>A library of books covered the walls with ancient leather-bound books. The only exception was the wall of glass beyond which the midmorning sun shone in rays through the city&rsquo;s hazy sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You all remember my grandson,&rdquo; Randall Pera was a domineering figure despite his age. At eighty his girth was still solid, his eyes were sharp, and stark white hair styled in a military flat top. To his right sat Michael Cormier, one of the richest Ascendants, so far as Sonny knew one of the richest people in the world. Next to him was a man that Sonny only knew by reputation, David Butler, he&rsquo;d been a top aide for Ronald Reagan and now advised the Bush White House. Last in the room was Dr. Cynthia Blackwell, whose presence both irritated and unnerved him.</p>
<p>His grandfather ushered him in, stopping to put a firm hand on his upper arm as he passed. He whispered into Sonny&rsquo;s ear while slapping his back, &ldquo;this had better not be a waste of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the table, he ushered Sonny to sit, &ldquo;you may have a minute to get your things in order.&rdquo; The old man snapped his fingers Dylan marched to his side, &ldquo;bring us coffee.&rdquo; The young man retreated silently.</p>
<p>Sonny removed the contents of his bag, forming three neat stacks around him. Folder of papers in front, photographs to his right, and a battery-powered cassette player on his left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready,&rdquo; he told them as Dylan returned with their coffee.</p>
<p>When he heard the doors closing behind him, his throat tightened and the room pitched. He gripped the edge of the table for a moment to regain his bearings before beginning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toward the end of January, I suspected Special Agent Holland&rsquo;s commitment to the Order was wavering. During that time he met several times with persons of interest in Medford Oregon leading up to the release of Danny and Jeannie Avery. This happened over my objection and before we could take Nicholas Starr into custody.</p>
<p>Dr. Blackwell interrupted, &ldquo;we know all this, we are not here for a history lesson. After Vegas, you asked permission to investigate Holland, and we gave you limited autonomy to carry out surveillance on your own. Now unless we are all wasting our time here, it&rsquo;s time to present your evidence. Please get to the point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Damn, but she was a hard bitch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right, I was getting there,&rdquo; he turned over the first picture from the stack. &ldquo;That is is Carter Holland with his back to the camera, photographed here in the middle of a clandestine meeting with Ahmed Farouk in New Orleans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned another photo over and slid it across the table. &ldquo;Holland is a hard man to tail, but our resident towel head has all the street smarts of a five-year-old. My local tailed him to this military test facility.&rdquo; He turned over the next picture and the one after that, pushing them both forward again. &ldquo;Two more people showed up that day. The first, seen here, Special Agent Carter Holland, and the one he&rsquo;s holding the door for has to be Nicholas Starr.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He returned to the stack in front, pulling out three sheets of mimeograph paper. &ldquo;I copied these two from our record books at the evidence rooms and this from Farouk&rsquo;s lab. When I learned Farouk was at another lab, I checked New York and found the relic was missing. Farouk stopped all work on the relic a week before it went missing, scheduling his staff to other tasks. He checked it into evidence room two on April 23rd, and if I hadn&rsquo;t checked the box, no one would know that it wasn&rsquo;t there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pulled out a folder with several dozen pages stuffed inside &ldquo;These are all the reports Farouk has made on the relic in the month since returning from that trip. As opposed to these in these for the four preceding months,&rdquo; he pushed three sheets of paper next to the folder. &ldquo;I believe that purpose of this trip was to meet with Starr so that he could teach Farouk how to use the relic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His grandfather held up a hand to stop him, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s mere conjecture. What makes you think this is Starr on the motorcycle? And what&rsquo;s wrong with the picture, why does it look like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why it looks like that. The Marine who took it couldn&rsquo;t remember anything out of the ordinary about the bike, other than that it was weird looking. He said it was a cross between a sportbike and a motocross. As for why think it&rsquo;s Starr, it&rsquo;s more than conjecture.&rdquo; He went back into the pile of papers, digging for a moment until he found what he wanted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked logistics for photographic analysis. Using the size of agent Holland and the motorcycle, they gave an approximate height and weight for our biker. These estimates put him at six foot two and 190 to 200 pounds, that&rsquo;s a perfect match for Starr.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This local Marine of yours, did he get the license plate number of that machine,&rdquo; Blackwell asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it was too far away to read with the naked eye and he thought it would be visible in the photos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are more photos?&rdquo; Sonny shrugged and pushed the remaining stack of photos across the table. Dr. Blackwell picked them up, looking at each, and turned and handed it to her right. &ldquo;These two from the front are the only usable photos in the entire stack. Did your contact explain why all of these photos are overexposed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t, but one of our analysts in logistics did. Aimee Delgado, who for the record stated three months ago that she felt Starr was using a motorcycle. Delgado&rsquo;s theory is that there are several hidden light sources on or around the rear bike, maybe even aimed at refraction device causing lens flare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s more,&rdquo; he pushed more papers toward the council. These call logs of numbers that Holland has made or received calls from since I started watching him. Each sheet represents one device, his car phone, his pager, desk phone, home phone, and even the payphone across the street from his office. You&rsquo;ll notice he uses the payphone to call numbers in Oregon, Nevada, and New Orleans after receiving anonymous messages on his pager.&rdquo;
Sonny picked up the audio cassette and held it up in front of him, &ldquo;and then there&rsquo;s this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put the tape in and pressed play. A southern drawl came through over the recording;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Setting up on Spain Street, the target is visible at 70 yards. Checking mic,&rdquo; The sounds of laughter buzzed in and out with a Doppler effect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spend most of my,&rdquo; Farouk&rsquo;s recognizably gentle voice and Iranian accent faded in and then out again. A moment later it returned with clarity. &ldquo;idiot, do you think he&rsquo;s here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, and I think I know where to look. Our scheduled rendezvous is in a little under 48 hours. We meet him at stage 3 at 4:30 PM the day after tomorrow. At least that&rsquo;s what his postcard said. Me risking my career on this is one thing: I need to figure out what he&rsquo;s up to if I&rsquo;m going to risk yours. I have already made a circuit of the French quarter and picked up a few contacts and a lead. Remind me to thank Delgado for her insight if we get the chance. She&rsquo;s a sharp one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what do I do in the meantime?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to the festival, have some fun. That music and distance is coming from President Steamboat, they have three stages in there. When was the last time you enjoyed a simple night out? This is not like Iran before the revolution. You don&rsquo;t have to worry about who sees you, and no one is going to hold it against you. Plus it is part of your cover story and you have a poster of Stevie Ray Vaughan in your office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why the secrecy, Carter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are an important scientist and your activities and whereabouts are indeed being monitored. But the secrecy is not to hide what you are doing from anyone. No one back at headquarters knows we met in seventy-seven. That op was so dark it&rsquo;s not even in my CIA file. But just because there&rsquo;s no connection on the surface doesn&rsquo;t mean that people won&rsquo;t ask questions if it gets out that we&rsquo;re meeting off mission. Of course, there&rsquo;s the unauthorized removal and transport of the relic, but that&rsquo;s a different issue. So, I can tell my words are not relaxing you the way I had intended. I&rsquo;m going to go. You should too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned off the recorder, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s that comment about Delgado that clinches the deal. I believe he is referring to the same speculative I did. Holland must&rsquo;ve been able to track him down through the motorcycle. We don&rsquo;t know who the Saturday contact was, it never took place. My best guess is that Holland has been conspiring with Sheriff Smith and Nicholas Starr for a while. The rendezvous mentioned would&rsquo;ve been the one that the Sheriff or Nicholas himself set up. My guess is, Holland didn&rsquo;t like them set the terms and put his CIA training to use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should have led with this,&rdquo; Dr. Blackwell breathed. &ldquo;Who else have you told about this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only my father, who got the message to you,&rdquo; he said, looking at his grandfather. &ldquo;I asked for a general reassignment review because if I were Holland, I&rsquo;d be monitoring all channels. Dad and I figured that if we called an emergency meeting, it might tip him off. If Farouk hadn&rsquo;t returned with the relic, we would&rsquo;ve called an emergency meeting right then, but he&rsquo;s making progress and I was content to watch and wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can step outside, while we discuss this.&rdquo; Blackwell waved her hand at him, already turning to the other three. He retreated, closing the doors behind him. The minutes stretched on and he fought the urge to lie down on the couch. Sometimes it was the only way he could fight off vertigo. The door opened, Randall Pera standing at the threshold. A tiny nod of recognition passed between them. His grandfather turned and walked back to the table, Sonny followed.</p>
<p>The documents now sat in front of David Butler, and he took the lead as Sonny sat. &ldquo;Initiate Pera your request for reassignment is granted. You will report to the local section chief at the Pentagon in Washington DC. I have instructed him to give you full access. We have issued wiretap orders for Carter Holland&rsquo;s communication devices, and we will assign a team to monitor them for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ascendant Cormier took over, &ldquo;we would like you to work on tracking down Nicholas Starr. Employ any means within reason. Once you&rsquo;ve located Mr. Starr, you are to take him into custody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Blackwell continued, &ldquo;Carter Holland is an exceptionally useful asset and a high-ranking Companion. Take every precaution not to retire his talents before necessary. That being said, if he tries to prevent you from taking Starr into custody, do what you have to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Randall Pera now stood, the other rising with him. Sonny stood, heart racing as his grandfather spoke the words. &ldquo;Initiate Pera, we hereafter recognize you as Companion Pera. Congratulations. Be vigilant, be wary, be ready..&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack Starr stood in the doorway Of Lafitte&rsquo;s Blacksmith Shop, scanning the crowd. Sonny half rose in his chair to wave him over.
&ldquo;So, congratulations are in order, cum laude in physics with a minor in mathematics, no mean feat. Have you given any more thought to our offer?&rdquo;
Jack took his hand in a vigorous shake before seating himself across the table. &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; his head swiveled around the room to take in the ambiance. Lafitte&rsquo;s was both one of the oldest structures in the French Quarter and one of the oldest bars in America. Pitch-soaked timbers showed between brick walls covered in places with a layer of ancient mud from the 1700s. The dim room was empty but for a few patrons at the bar. New Orleans was not the most popular destination during the summer months.</p>
<p>Jack continued, &ldquo;I have thought about the offer, a lot actually. There are just so many things to consider. For instance, Intel is gearing up for massive expansion over the next five years. One of my friends wants to get me to join him there. And then there&rsquo;s this company that&rsquo;s doing some cool interface work on computers. I got a prerelease version of this operating software called Windows, I think it&rsquo;s going to be huge, maybe even as big as Apple. The whole working for the government thing sounds cool at first,&rdquo; he drifted off in mid-sentence as a middle-aged man squeezed himself into the slim corner behind the piano and music filled the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack, I get it. You&rsquo;re right to question which is the better path for you, but you&rsquo;re missing some important information.&rdquo; His eyes flashed back from the piano, curiosity written across his face. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a smart guy, Jack. I will not talk you into anything, but I hope you will recognize the truth in what I&rsquo;m about to say. My loyalty is not to the FBI,&rdquo; he let the admission sink in.</p>
<p>As Jack nodded, he continued, &ldquo;learned and powerful men founded our country. This democracy is a grand experiment that not even they were not convinced would work. They understood that new industry and freedoms would create unprecedented wealth even as it demanded an impoverished working class. Men like Jefferson believed everyone could prosper if only the government provided the right opportunities and education. Others, worked hard behind the scenes to ensure that the New World didn&rsquo;t fall apart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you saying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That there are people who have been working to ensure our world continues on the right course, and I am one of those people. We exist within and beyond government. I&rsquo;m saying, maybe you don&rsquo;t have to choose. What if you could work doing the things you love and serve a higher calling at the same time? Jack, what if I told you that if join us it would increase your chances of landing those jobs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would get my attention, not that you don&rsquo;t have it,&rdquo; he finished with a grin. &ldquo;So, how would that work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, first you need a sponsor,&rdquo; Sonny returned the grin. &ldquo;Next there would be a period of evaluation. After which the sponsor approaches the candidate to discuss the candidates' cover occupation and how they will contribute to the organization. It is then up to the candidate, with a little help, to get into their chosen occupation. In my case that was the FBI, I attended and completing academy training and passing all the required background checks necessary. In your case, you and your sponsor would pick an achievement inside your target organization. For example, we might agree that you would need to be a senior researcher or an engineering manager or lead in product development, once you&rsquo;ve achieved that target provided you have done the work with your sponsor and kept in contact, you will become an Initiate in the Order of the Founders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Founders?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Founders, as in the founding fathers' Jack. Think about it like this, at the municipal level the police and the DA report to the Mayor. The Mayor reports up to the Governor who then reports up to the federal government. As you follow the chain up each branch of the government to the highest positions, you will find a Founder behind every desk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assuming I&rsquo;m interested, what would be the next step?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack, we need to measure your ability and your commitment. Before you answer, before you interrupt, let me explain something. If you do this, everything about who you are, about who your family is, will change. There will never again be doors that are barred to you because of status. The price will seem high at first, Jack, we need you to bring in your son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sonny held up a hand as Jack bristled, &ldquo;your son has involved himself in some very dangerous affairs. If you don&rsquo;t do this, he could end up dead before his birthday. He does not know the waters he swimming in, he&rsquo;s in so far over his head he can even see the surface. You would do this as much to protect him as to demonstrate your commitment and your loyalty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They both stared at the piano player, neither saying anything for several long moments. Returning to Pera, Jack shook his head, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to decide anything today. Nick is here in town, we don&rsquo;t know where and we don&rsquo;t want to draw any unnecessary attention. I am giving you a two-week all-expenses-paid vacation no matter what. Your hotel room is a few blocks down Bourbon Street from here. If nothing else, it&rsquo;s the opportunity of a lifetime to blow off a little steam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He handed over a room key and an envelope full of cash. &ldquo;There are some things you need to know about Nick. He has changed Jack, if we don&rsquo;t get him back soon, you&rsquo;ll probably never see him again. You don&rsquo;t have to do anything special, just go out and have fun. He will find you, although he may follow you for several days before making contact, so if you catch sight of him, don&rsquo;t let on. I&rsquo;m going to go stay with a friend outside of the city. This is the last time I&rsquo;ll show my face here until you message me. Nick won&rsquo;t show unless he knows you&rsquo;re alone. Jack, there&rsquo;s one more thing I think you need to see before you decide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sonny reached under his chair and took out a manila envelope. Inside were full-page glossy prints from the aftermath of Las Vegas. One showed the marks around Wallace&rsquo;s neck, another the bruising covering Sonny&rsquo;s torso and shoulders. Still more showed Sonny&rsquo;s eye swollen shut, and the watermelon-sized bruise that ran across his forehead and temple. The final two photographs were CT scans of Sonny&rsquo;s brain, each with notes from the neurologist explaining the damage and probable long-term effects. He handed the envelope to Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to have a look these over when you get back to your room. We almost had him in February. Did you know Nick was living in Vegas then? Anyway, you&rsquo;ll find pictures in there, I want you to examine them. Your son was responsible for all of what you&rsquo;ll see in those pictures. We knew he was gambling at the Stardust and had an entire team there just to make contact. He attacked one of my guys and ran before we could announce ourselves. I tried to stop him and he tackled me. You think you know your son Jack, but I was a collegiate wrestling champion and graduated top of my class in all combat arts. Your son didn&rsquo;t just beat me, he put me in the hospital. Read the physician&rsquo;s assessment, every word is true. I&rsquo;m still recovering, and before you get paranoid about it, don&rsquo;t worry, this isn&rsquo;t a revenge mission. I just want you to know that he&rsquo;s into some serious shit. He took me by surprise and I held back because of his age, but he&rsquo;s mixing in some very dangerous circles now if we don&rsquo;t get to him soon I don&rsquo;t know what will happen. Think on it, stay the two weeks no matter what. If I hear from you… I hope I do, but if I don&rsquo;t Jack, it&rsquo;s been a pleasure,&rdquo; he stood without another word and left the bar.</p>
