<h1>Chapter 19</h1>

<br><br>
<p>Nick drove his bike through the Marigny, taking Charters Street down into the upper 9th Ward. The road followed a series of ports on the Mississippi, all with rail access. He followed the tracks to Pauline Street, pulling to a stop around the corner in front of a long single-story warehouse. The concrete building was whitewashed with a rusting iron gate in front of a lonely man-door. There appeared to be no other entryway into the building.</p>
<p>As it turned off the motorcycle, the door opened and Holland gestured him inside. &ldquo;Can you squeeze that thing in here?&rdquo; He stayed on the bike and walked through the doorway. &ldquo;Along the wall is fine, you don’t need to worry about it being in the way, we have the place to ourselves.&rdquo; The inside of the building the floors gleamed with a top-end high-gloss finish, the walls and the ceiling were all painted pristine white. The space looked like the showroom for an upscale auto dealership. Overly bright lights reflected off of the floor.
Several grey office desks with computers occupied the right half of the room.</p>
<p>Other than the door behind him, only a single watertight steel boat door broke the perfect wall of white to his left. The pale blue door with its huge dual cams sat open, protruding into the square of yellow and black floor directly in front of it. A single oval light blinked green over the center of the portal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a shared military lab. All the local branches have bases within several miles, and they this space for testing and investigations. It&rsquo;s ours for the day. Come on, I want you to meet Farouk.&rdquo; He held the door and motioned for Nick to enter, pulling the door closed behind them and spinning the wheel dog the cams. Inside was a long hallway with several doors lining each wall. Holland led them through the only open door, another green light blinking overhead.</p>
<p>Inside, he recognized the room as an anechoic chamber. It was an electromagnetic testing facility. Huge sections of triangular foam covered the metal-plated walls. In the middle, a raised dais would rotate to expose test objects from all sides. Large directional antennas aimed inward from the corners.</p>
<p>A man with dusky brown skin and a hint of gray in his black mustache was standing in the center of the room wearing a Hawaiian shirt and cargo shorts. &ldquo;Nick, this is Dr. Ahmed Farouk, he&rsquo;s one of our top scientists back at headquarters and he&rsquo;s been in charge of figuring out what your little rock does. Ahmed, this is Nick Starr.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick moved forward to shake the man&rsquo;s hand and as he did, an object sitting on a pedestal behind the man caught his eye. &ldquo;Is that it?&rdquo; He asked as he shook the man&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, this is the relic, as they call it. Hold on a minute before you approach it. Let me get set up. Agent Carter and I will move behind that alcove we will watch through the glass and on the camera. When I turn, everything on the lights in the corner of the room will come on and you may approach the object. Okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That works for me Doc.&rdquo; He waited while they retreated behind the wall a moment later yellow light spilled out from around the corner and both men visible through the glass. The doctor was busy flipping switches and lights around the room came on. His voice came through over an intercom, &ldquo;please walk forward and take the object.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick looked at the object, he felt it pushing on his consciousness. “Hey guys, I can feel it, it’s like facing a blazing fire. Are you sure this thing is safe?”</p>
<p>“Describe the sensation, please.”</p>
<p>“It tingles, there is no heat, that just the closest analogy I can think of. It’s like a wall of pressure.</p>
<p>“Hold on a second, I’m still calibrating.”</p>
<p>He watched Farouq pacing back and forth to lean over in behind the screen. “Nick, you are right it&rsquo;s radiating a new signal!” Nick heard the excitement in the doctor’s voice. “It is very weak, Nick. I don’t know how you can… oh my. Carter, can you move antenna number three? Nick, can you take one step closer?”</p>
<p>Holland stood in the corner with hands on the wall mount of the large multi-pronged device. It bristled with measurement devices from cameras to microphones, “where am I pointing this thing?”</p>
<p>“At Mr. Starr. Yes, right there, stop right there, Allahu akbar! Nick, you’re… talking to it. This is incredible. Carter, come back here.”</p>
<p>Holland glanced over, making eye contact. Nick shrugged at the unspoken question, “I’m not doing anything that I know of doctor. Can you elaborate?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, perhaps. This is a scientific inference only, because it’s outside of measurable ranges for this equipment. I didn’t bring an EEG rig, but I would wager your brain is communicating with that device. I’ve never seen it do this. I have to rearrange the sensor array before checking the magnetic field.” The device in the corner whirled and clicked. After a moment Farouk’s continued, “this thing is producing more than twice the magnetic field of the earth, about 1.2 gauss. This is just great. You know there have been recent studies that suggest humans can detect geomagnetic fields. There are a million follow-up tests I want to run from this result alone.”</p>
<p>“Ahmed,” Holland broke in. “We don’t have time. I know you, we could spend days devising new experiments, but we have to stick to the plan.”</p>
<p>“Okay, you’re right,” disappointment dominated the doctor’s body language. “The device is safe, Nick. None of the signals have a magnitude dangerous to humans. I really want to know how you can sense them at all?” He blew out an exasperated breath, “but for now please proceed.”</p>
<p>Nick fixed his gaze upon the object. He had seen something like it before, or rather he had seen something this black before. In his late 50s, he had entered early retirement to pursue a doctorate in physics. Teaching part-time had always been in his retirement plan. It had been the early days of China’s claim of atomic precision manufacturing. Researchers all over the United States answered the call to action. Nano-scaled pursuits flourished overnight.</p>
<p>One of his professors had developed a composite paint that would break the world record for 99.995% light absorption. The previous record was made by growing a layer of carbon-nanotubes over cellular aluminum. Unlike the aluminum structures, once applied, the paint rendered any object the purest black. He remembered the way the Rubik’s cube lost all shape except silhouette. It had been intriguing and unnerving at the same time to walk around the cube. Your brain convinced you are looking at a two-dimensional object even as the profile changed.</p>
<p>The relic was black in much the same way. The matter how hard he tried to perceive a third dimension, his eyes just couldn’t pick out the details. Right now it looked like a black cardboard cutout in the vague shape of the Apollo command module. It was triangular, except with graceful curving edges and no corners. He reached forward with deliberate slowness, to rest the pad of his index finger against the indecipherable surface. It was smooth like glass and cool to the touch.</p>
<p>It wasn’t so much seeing more detail as it was visualizing it. The moment his finger touched the relic, an image exploded in his mind’s eye, superimposed over his field of view. He slid his finger surface toward the top, extending his hand forward until the object was under his palm. He closed his fingers around it and turned his hand over to hold it like an apple. From within his grip, the object demanded his attention, drawing his focus until the surrounding room was a blur.</p>
<p>It felt right, familiar, comforting. Holding it. He opened his hand to study it balanced on his palm. A slender blue arc of light grew from the surface, extending away from him. The arc grew upwards, vine-like until it crested at eye level before falling again. “Are you guys seeing this?” As he stared at the blue line floating in front of him, another arc broke the surface. This one was silvery-white and brighter than the blue. “Oh, wow. You guys?”</p>
<p>Nick pulled his attention away from the light show to look over at the screen. The images collapsed as the room returned to focus. Both Holland and Dr. Farouq seemed unmoved. “Did you see that?” he asked again.</p>
<p>“See what?” Holland asked into the microphone.</p>
<p>“The lights, the curving paths of light that came out of the relic.” He knew they hadn’t. They shared a glance at each other, before Dr. Farouk’s response.</p>
<p>“When did this happen?”</p>
<p>“When I picked up the object and opened up my hand. It was mesmerizing. They grew like vines in a time-lapse film. The blue must’ve taken thirty or forty seconds to stretch out all the way to the end. When it finished another one started growing, but this one was silvery-white and bright. You guys have no idea what I’m talking about, do you?”</p>
<p>“No, how long did you say you watched the lights?” Farouk again.
“I don’t know, a minute a minute and a half.”</p>
<p>They looked at each other again, “we missed it. Can you make it happen again?”</p>
<p>“I hope so,” he turned to stare back into the blackness of the relic, letting it pull him inward until everything else faded away. He thought about the blue line and it appeared in the instant of that thought. Nick reached out with his left hand to touch the very end of the arc, he had to stretch fingers all the way there, but it was there at the end of his reach.</p>
<p>“Grandpa,” squeeze,</p>
<p>“Grandpa,” squeeze.</p>
<p>The memory had come back with the ferocity that shook him to his core. His legs felt unsteady, but he stayed upright. His heart was now hammering under his shirt with enough force to move the fabric of his shirt. He touched a point near the top.</p>
<p>It was dark in the bar, only votive candles and dim red lights shone in the busy lounge. He glanced at the fitted T-shirt he was wearing in the mirror, noting with pleasure the way it accentuated his physique. He pushed the money into the register and turned around to give Marissa her change.</p>
<p>“You should come and say hi when you get a chance,” she was saying. He and Marissa had been good friends for about a decade. She was brash and opinionated in a way that made her seem carefree and strong. He knew it was an act to cover for her need to be accepted, to be valued. It was that need which made her loyal, sometimes to a fault where her friends were concerned. “I brought my friend Bianca, do you remember her from the party last week?”</p>
<p>Subtlety was not one of Marissa’s strong suits, and he was gearing up for a firm but polite rejection as he looked over to the elevated seating area that sometimes served as a stage. Two groups of regulars sat in clusters around the low tables of the far left side, a young woman sat by herself against the right wall of the lounge. She was pretty and Nick could tell from here and she was a little uncomfortable. Her posture a bit too perfect, hands on her knees as she looked around the room. She found Marissa at the bar and noticed him staring. Her large brown eyes looked hopeful, if startled, but Nick saw his entire life in those eyes.</p>
<p>It disappeared in a flash, a single powerful snippet of memory that left him shaking. He set the relic back onto the pedestal and wiped the tears from his eyes “give me a minute,” he said with a voice that cracked with emotion. He turned and walked back toward the door, stopping when he realized that it was still closed and barred. Bianca, he hadn’t seen her face since 2035. Gone one day after 33 years together, reliving the moment their introduction felt like tearing out a piece of his heart. Not wanting to cry in front of the others, Nick wiped his eyes and forced himself into some breathing exercises.</p>
<p>He heard footsteps approaching from behind. He gave his eyes one more wipe and turned around to meet Holland. “Are you okay, Nick?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’m fine, I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>Holland was staring at him, face tight with concentration or concern. “You ready to try again?”</p>
<p>“Try what again?”</p>
<p>“To make the lights appear, Ahmed asked you if you could make it happen again, we thought you were going to try. Can… Are you sure you’re okay?”</p>
<p>He realized he was staring open-mouthed and closed it with an audible snap. He walked back toward the relic, beckoning Holland to follow. “I said, I hope so, and I focused on this object for…” He looked around the room, trying to estimate how long the experience felt. “If I had to guess ten minutes. I’m guessing it was different from your viewpoint?”</p>
<p>Holland inspected the pedestal for a moment before answering Nick without looking at him. He held his hand out arm straight pantomiming Nick’s actions. “You turned your head and put the relic down at about this speed,” he said, completing the sequence in a second and one a half. “Then you turned your back and walked away,” Holland turned again to Nick as he finished.</p>
<p>They both turned toward Farouk behind the screen. “Okay, what did the sensors pick up doctor?”</p>
<p>“Almost nothing. I’ve been running a Fourier analysis and I can verify some high-frequency signals during the time you held the device. But only when I filter out the background noise. The amplitude of the signal isn’t large enough for me to pick out in by itself.”</p>
<p>“How do you know the signals are there if you can’t pick them out?” Holland asked.</p>
<p>Nick responded first “he’s using a mathematical transformation which changes the signal from the time domain to the frequency domain. Computers are great at analyzing repetitions it makes them fantastic at running Fourier analysis. Have you attempted a convolution to return them to the time domain doctor?”</p>
<p>“I was just trying to work that out.” His words came out slow and stilted as his head tilted to the side. “How do you know about Fourier analysis?”</p>
<p>“It’s the only gateway from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics. Call it a hobby of mine.” Nick tried to suppress a grin as the baffled expression on Farouk’s face deepened. “Walk me through this. When anyone touches that thing, it sends out a burst of high-frequency radiation, yes?”</p>
<p>“That’s right,” Farouk answered.</p>
<p>“The strength of that sequence is readable by your instruments?”</p>
<p>“It is.”</p>
<p>“Is sequence the same for me as for Holland, or you?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, I haven’t checked yet,” disappearing to the sound of rifling papers. He returned to view, waving a single printed page. “This is the signal it sent out when you touched it, Nick. Carter, if you touch it now we can compare them side-by-side.”</p>
<p>Holland eyeballed Nick for a second before responding, “right now?”</p>
<p>“Yes, now,” he chuckled. “We’ve come all this way, why would we stop?”</p>
<p>He cut Nick one more look of irritation before reaching out to touch the object. “Now what?”</p>
<p>“That’s it,” Farouk was saying, but Nick had seen the briefest of flashes inside that deep black surface when Holland had closed his hand around it. Farouk tore another sheet of paper from somewhere and was now holding them side-by-side, “they’re the same!”</p>
<p>Holland was still holding the object and looking at Nick. He was aware of the relic’s presence again. This time, instead of pushing him away, it seemed to want action. “Doctor, you should watch this.” He stepped forward and put his hand over the top of Holland’s.</p>
<p>An ear-piercing shriek erupted from Holland’s throat as his back arched and his entire body tightened. The wail continued as his body shook and he collapsed toward the ground. Nick dove forward to catch him, bring him to rest at the base of the pedestal. Farouk was beside him, hand on Holland’s chest and two fingers on the artery of his neck. The noise coming from Holland died off as the air in his lungs ran out and he slipped into unconsciousness.</p>
<p>“He’s still breathing. What did you do?”</p>
<p>“I touched it while he was holding it,” he answered, only half paying attention. A ferocious storm of activity inside the object held his attention. Little flashes of light traveled upward as if it was a replica of an electrical storm. “Doctor,” he enunciated while nudging the other man. Farouk glanced at him and followed Nick’s gaze toward the object and Holland’s grip. “Tell me you can see it this time.”</p>
<p>“Allahu akbar,” he whispered, touching the fingertips of both hands to his forehead. He threw out an arm pointing behind the screen, “there’s a portable film recorder back there quick, bring it to me.” Nick quick-stepped behind the screen and found a new Betamax video cassette recorder behind the screen. He fiddled with it for a moment before finding the eject button.</p>
<p>“There’s a tape in here can I recorder over it?”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes. Hurry.” He fumbled with it for a moment, trying to get the record button to the press before realizing the error of his ways. Pressing record and play together, he looked through the tiny window to make sure the cassette was turning and hurried to put the relic in view.</p>
<p>“No, stop it and give it to me.” Farouk didn’t wait for Nick to follow the instructions, taking the video recorder from him. He stopped the tape and rewound it, “move out of the frame, we have to be careful that only Holland and I are visible.” After rewinding the tape, he began the recording again, this time narrating.</p>
<p>“This is Dr. Ahmed Farouk the time is 9:41 AM May 3, 1985. One minute ago at 9:40, Special Agent Carter Holland activated the relic. It has rendered him unconscious, but he is otherwise stable. The relic is showing visible signs of activity,” he bent over to get very close to the object while focusing. “This light pattern inside the relic looks like the neural pathways of a human brain. I think that is mapping Holland’s brain as I am recording. Watch the white lines branch out from the cerebral cortex. When they reach the end of a pathway, the branch turns blue and before bifurcating to connect with other branches.” Farouk continued filming for several minutes, stopping now and again to check the clock on the wall.</p>
<p>“It is now 9:54 AM and special agent Carter Holland has now been unconscious for 14 1/2 minutes. He is showing signs of recovery now. Note to self, check this mapping time versus the length of the anomaly on December 2. I suspect they will be very close. Also, I will need to schedule MRIs, CAT scans with contrast for agent Holland. I need to compare this footage with a proper model of his neural pathways. One more note, if agent Holland can now activate the device I need to schedule it EEG survey to find out which parts of his brain react to interacting with it.”</p>
<p>Holland let out a soft groan and rolled to his side, massaging his temples. “What the hell,” he croaked. He studied his surroundings as Farouk turned off the recording. “What happened?” Holland was scanning the floor, looking for his own blood, Nick guessed. He knew that pain first hand.</p>
<p>“Based on what the good doctor was saying, this thing made a map your brain. Are you with me, Holland?”</p>
<p>He stood up and brushed off his clothes. “I’m with you Nicholas,” he spoke the words like an oath and they shared a nod.</p>
<p>Farouk broke in, “what was that?”</p>
<p>“What was what,” they both said together.</p>
<p>Farouk shook his extended index finger back and forth between the two of them. “Something happened there. What are you not telling me?”</p>
<p>“Dr. Farouk, what happened to agent Holland, it happened to me as well. It’s a painful experience. Anyway, I blacked out when I touched the device and when I came to I left it lying there on the ground. When I told him, he was skeptical. So what you witnessed was a silent acknowledgment that he believes me now, at least that’s how I took it.” He looked to Holland, hoping to prompt the man.</p>
<p>There was no flicker or sign of what he was thinking before he spoke. “That’s it, more or less.” Holland picked the relic up off the floor, and held it up in front of his eyes, uncurling his fingers. A moment later he closed them, “did either of you catch a glimpse of my arc?” When Nick shook his head, Holland continued, “there’s a big question you need to answer, Ahmed.” Holland turned to hold the relic out, “my friend, do you want to see what we’ve seen. I can promise you it will hurt, but I believe you will find it worthwhile.”</p>
