<h1>Chapter 8</h1>

<br><br>
<p>&ldquo;Jack, Jack. The pleasure was all mine!&rdquo; Pera looked at the glassy shine in his companion&rsquo;s eyes. The neon lights hanging behind him in the window of the bar reflecting their glow in the watery orbs. &ldquo;We need people like you at the Agency,&rdquo; he concluded.
&ldquo;Agent Pera, don&rsquo;t bullshit me, dude. The Airforce already did that once.&rdquo; The big guy swayed a little, then continued. &ldquo;They screwed me! Said I didn&rsquo;t have what it took to be in the space program.&rdquo; He straightened up in his seat and changed his tone to emulate military correctness. &ldquo;Candidate Starr, you had great ASVAB and AFOQT scores. Arithmetic Reasoning, Numerical Operations, and Coding Speed are all very strong. You should make the Space program with ease if you distinguish yourself, they said. What a load! Didn&rsquo;t have the psychological makeup for the program, they said after OTS. After! But, hey you would be a great fit for meteorology. As if. I left Austin the next day,&rdquo; he finished with a chuckle.</p>
<p>Pera stood up and took the man&rsquo;s hand and upper arm using the insider&rsquo;s handshake. &ldquo;First off, call me Sonny. And no I am not bullshitting you. We need guys like you, Jack. You may not know this but a lot of guys coming out of the physics programs aren&rsquo;t real social,&rdquo; he jested with a wink. &ldquo;Nerds don&rsquo;t usually come with personality, not that you&rsquo;re a nerd Jack.&rdquo;
Sunny released his grip as they made their way to the door. &ldquo;Jack, you said you were a Feynman fan, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know it,&rdquo; he interjected.
&ldquo;Right, so you otta know that Feynman works with us all the time, has since the Manhattan Project. Maybe we could arrange a meet if you come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They reached the door and Jack turned back looking hopeful, &ldquo;I still have my last quarter to finish. You won&rsquo;t forget about me and move on before the spring?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly, Jack. We will be staying in touch, okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know it! Man, Jane is going to flip out!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Hey man, no you can&rsquo;t do that yet, remember? If you tell anyone about this before you get your official clearance it will kill your cover options. If you ever want to do fieldwork, you can&rsquo;t tell anyone until you know your cover, got it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack nodded his head with enough vigor that he stumbled again, &ldquo;got it,&rdquo; he slurred. He paused one last time at the door to give Pera a boyish look of hope. Sonny wasn&rsquo;t impressed, the routine looked rehearsed. He watched Jack head out into the night and wondered if the manipulation was intentional. More likely it was so ingrained that he did it on a subconscious level. Somehow, despite Jack&rsquo;s fragile ego and his constant need for affirmation, Pera liked him.
He was a blast to hang out with. Jack was smart, in a see right to the heart of the issue and turn it on its head, kind of way. And the man could tell a story! He had great timing and a flair for the dramatic. Pera made his way to a table in the back where Cassie and Sandra were still huddled into the booth that he and Jack had spent most of the evening at.</p>
<p>Jack had kept the laddies laughing nonstop while he laid on the charm. Sonny glanced at his watch, it was past two in the morning and he wanted to get out of the dirty bar.
&ldquo;Where did Jack go?&rdquo; Cassie whined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably went home to his wife and kids Cassie,&rdquo; he shot back as he slid down into the booth next to Sandra.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Carrie, you jerk, are you being serious? That guy is married?&rdquo; She broke out laughing. &ldquo;Too bad&hellip;&rdquo; she turned to Sandra and they finished in unison, &ldquo;for his wife!&rdquo; Now they were both laughing hard. Sonny watched their bangs jiggle their big hoop earrings wiggle with a crooked smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, this place is dead. What do you say, ladies, you wanna roll somewhere else?&rdquo; He took a twinkie-sized bag of white powder out of his pocket and held it up in front of them. &ldquo;Do you ladies like to party?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh my god!&rdquo; Sandra said squeezing his thigh, &ldquo;who doesn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; They were all laughing as they made their way out of the bar.</p>
<hr>
<p>Sunny could hear a shower running somewhere distant. He opened his eyes to a blinding wash of yellows and whites. The room was spinning like an amusement park ride. His eyes felt like they were full of ground glass. Fighting off an aggressive bout of nausea, he fumbled around the floor until he found his pants.
He pulled them on and sat for a minute at the edge of the low bed. The room was sunlit, with large bay windows facing out to a street several stories below. The bathroom where the shower was still running was one of only two doors. He stood up and dug in his pocket for his pager. There were two messages from the same number, the first at 7:15 am and the second marked urgent at 10:30. &ldquo;Fuck,&rdquo; he mumbled trying to find the rest of his clothes. He was pulling on his shirt when the blonde, Cassie? No, Carrie, came into the room wrapped in a towel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, sleepy-head. You leaving already?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Um, morning. Yeah, I&rsquo;m late to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the Agency?&rdquo; She purred with a playful hint of mockery.
Fuck fuck fuck fuck! Why do I do this shit! How many people saw me with her, oh shit her friend must have left, does she know too? So much for playing it under the radar, dickhead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, don&rsquo;t look so spooked, I&rsquo;m not talking. Seriously though, you can&rsquo;t go anywhere looking like that.&rdquo; She walked by, giving him a peck on the cheek. &ldquo;Or smelling like that,&rdquo; she giggled. &ldquo;Go take a shower.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I need a change of clothes anyway, so I will shower at the hotel, but thanks.&rdquo; Pera made for the door, she caught his arm and pulled him back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute big shot, don&rsquo;t you want to get my number?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Why not, this job&rsquo;s gonna keep us here for a stretch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rolled her eyes at him and wrote down her number on a matchbook. &ldquo;You talk all tough and play rough, I like it!&rdquo; She shoved the number into his pocket and gave him a long deep kiss that had him questioning his resolve to leave.
&ldquo;See ya G-man,&rdquo; she was still grinning as she closed the door.</p>
<p>Pera made his way to a payphone and dialed the number on the pager.
&ldquo;Holland here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Pera.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Pera, you missed the meet with the local feds, tell me you made good with Starr at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did, he&rsquo;s in. You were right, he bought the cloak and dagger routine like a carp.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Unsurprising. The locals here gave us an unused conference room to set up in. I am here now. 1500 SW Market, how long will it take you to get here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bout an hour, got to take care of a couple things to do first.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Hurry up.&rdquo; The line went dead.</p>
<p>Jesus, black bastard is so fucking uptight! Thinks he&rsquo;s running shit. Why did I get stuck with him?
He was in a foul mood, still near vomiting, head pounding, he called a cab. 15 minutes later he was showing in his room at the Fith Avenue Suites on the edge of the downtown area.</p>
<p>He dressed and made his way on foot to a bar that the man at the front desk had suggested. The Cheerful Tortoise dominated the corner of the block at 6th and College Street. It sat looking like an over-sized Mexican restaurant. Inside it was dark and Pera breathed a sigh of relief, taking off his aviators.
&ldquo;Gimme a bloody Mary and a menu,&rdquo; he told the barkeep, without waiting to be greeted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoa, rough morning mister?&rdquo; The barkeep resembled a small woolly mammoth but seemed amiable.
&ldquo;Rough night more like. Give me a cheeseburger with slaw and some hot sauce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s big hairy fist set down his drink and before he walked to the back to holler at the cook. He returned and picked up where they left off. &ldquo;So rough, like too much fun, or rough like a country song?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Hm? Oh, hehe, nice. Good rough, but not good enough to forgive this hangover.&rdquo; Pera set the empty drink down on the bar, &ldquo;getting better though, give me another and close me out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He felt better after eating, he slipped on his aviators and made his way outside. He walked the half-mile to the FBI offices. Portland was a clean city, everywhere he looked there were green spaces and friendly faces. Pera felt a little overdressed in his New York winter attire. He was wide awake and feeling human by the time he made it to his destination.
The building was big and white and the only entrance on first Avenue was one full floor over street level. Pera climbed the imposing stairs to a large open patio that sat in front of the building. Holland was waiting for him. He was drinking a cup of coffee from a large white ceramic mug with the blue FBI logo stamped on its side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was the I was beginning to think that you were going to show up.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I had some things to take care of like I said. So, where do we stand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could see the skin around Holland&rsquo;s eyes tightening in consternation. Pera wasn&rsquo;t interested in offering any further explanation at the moment.
After a brief pause, Holland continued, &ldquo;the section chief is meeting with the DA now. We are going to get an introduction tomorrow, and if we&rsquo;re lucky the DA will help get us a warrant for a wiretap. The star residence is 10 floors up a 16-floor high-rise in the Goose Hollow neighborhood. Which means there&rsquo;s almost no chance of us sneaking in and out unseen, so this is going to be by the book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took a couple of steps toward the door and turned back to continue. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like any of it. By the time we&rsquo;re done here somebody&rsquo;s bound to ask questions. Questions that we won&rsquo;t be able to answer without pulling strings.&rdquo; He finished his coffee and entered a code into the keypad next to the door.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get off the street. You can give me a rundown of your meet with Jack Starr upstairs,&rdquo; he offered, holding open the door.</p>
<p>Up on the fourth floor, Holland led them into the conference room. It had a single oval table large enough to seat about eight people. The room wasn&rsquo;t much bigger than the table. It was long and thin with the door at one end of the table and a tall narrow window at the other. It gave the impression of having been constructed out of necessity and not out of design. It was, however, away from the rest of the offices and the lunchroom so at least it offered them privacy.
At the far end of the table, a jumble of extension cords and wires were strewn about around several objects. The first was a brand-new desktop printer. It was one of the new dot-matrix kinds that had an auto feeder, its reem of paper spilling out and down to the floor. Next to it was a large cream-colored terminal display box. It was set up in the last seat by the window. The fold-out keyboard extended in front of it, on-screen an amber cursor was blinking after the word &lsquo;Login&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoa is that a PC? Is it on their mainframe?&rdquo;
&ldquo;It is, and I&rsquo;m told that it is somehow connected to ARPANET. Though I can&rsquo;t explain how. There&rsquo;s even some requisition forms over there that we can fill out if we need access to MILNET.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus Holland, you sound like a dinosaur. Do you know what you&rsquo;re talking about it all? This is cutting edge shit right here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holland stared at him in that disapproving way that he had. The man wielded silence like a weapon and had a stare that could peel paint. It was sometimes uncomfortable spending time in the same room with him. All Pera&rsquo;s attempts to get them to loosen up had fallen flat on their face. And it wasn&rsquo;t only Pera, he was pretty sure that Holland didn&rsquo;t like anyone. For the time being at least, he was Pera&rsquo;s superior, even if they both knew that Holland would be working for him someday soon.
Maybe that&rsquo;s why he doesn&rsquo;t like me, it&rsquo;s not really me, he&rsquo;s mad at the system. He&rsquo;s one of those Blacks that feels like he&rsquo;s owed something. He&rsquo;s probably just mad that I have connections.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway man, I meant that as a joke. This is just cool, do you know that we can connect the home-base directly here? Man with a little digging and poking we probably don&rsquo;t even need that form. We can go through all their files. All of it, and I mean all of it, FBI, NSA, CIA, the Pentagon, I mean all of it Holland. You know, we gotta tell headquarters about this right away. Did they just give this to you or did our guys arrange it?&rdquo;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to see you excited about something Pera. By all means contact home-base, they did not set this up. The locals here were very accommodating. They didn&rsquo;t even look at my badge number.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man, why do you look so down, this is awesome.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Pera, don&rsquo;t you see what an unbelievable lack of discipline this shows? The ramifications it has for our national security are dismal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus, that&rsquo;s why we do what we do. If it wasn&rsquo;t for home-base, who knows&hellip;&rdquo; He let the comment hang. Pera was already sitting in front of the terminal. &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s see what we can do. Where&rsquo;s the logon?&rdquo;
Holland reached into his pocket and pulled out a notebook. He flipped it open to the ribbon bookmark and placed it in front of Pera. &ldquo;I still want to hear about your meet with Jack Starr. But go ahead and contact home-base, see what you can find out. I&rsquo;m a walk across the street to that Persian restaurant on the corner and get some lunch.&rdquo; Holland stared at his watch for a second and then flashed one of his patented disapproving looks. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost 2 o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon already Pera. I&rsquo;ll be back in 30.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sonny watched him leave the room with a feeling of relief. He turned back to the keyboard and entered the login credentials. The terminal was indeed connected to the public ARPANET. He pulled several sheets of printer paper from the bottom of the stack and began mapping out any available hosts that he could reach. He was moving on to his third page when the door opened again and Holland came in smiling. He was too caught off guard to say anything, for once Holland was the first to speak.
&ldquo;You are not going to believe our dumb luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pera shrugged his shoulders in confusion. He was not used to expressions of amusement or excitement from Holland.
&ldquo;The restaurant across the street. The Iranian gentleman who served me is the owner. He was explaining to me some of the traditional dishes when our guy walks through the door. The owner says excuse me for a moment I must go talk to my prep cook. He walks over to talk for a few minutes. When he comes back I ask, is that your prep cook? And he says yeah prep cook and dishwasher. Then adds, Nick is a good boy, he had some trouble in school and missed a few weeks of work he tells me. I kept him talking by asking if he had to fire the kid. He says no, the kid is a good worker and that he is coming back to work the weekends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our Nick? Nicholas Starr, the whole reason we are here, works across the street?!&rdquo; He leaned back in his chair, &ldquo;holy shit!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yer Pera, holy shit. Now tell me what you got on the father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, like I said on the phone, everything you told me about the guy proved to be true. He&rsquo;s desperate for attention and emotionally fragile, pretty much a perfect mark. He wants to be more than a normal guy so bad that he didn&rsquo;t question anything I told him.&rdquo; Pera turned in the chair, &ldquo;I was thinking while you are out. Having access to this terminal could be a great way to bring him in. Jack is smart, and he&rsquo;s got plenty of experience with these computers. Get him in here, give him access to classified information, let him do some digging. He feels like a spy he gets comfortable and he&rsquo;ll do anything we ask.&rdquo;
&ldquo;That might work. Did you get him to talk about his family at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much at all. If I hadn&rsquo;t known he had a family and asked about it don&rsquo;t think he would&rsquo;ve ever mentioned it.&rdquo; Pera pushed himself back from the table and stood up. &ldquo;Here take a look at this. I&rsquo;ve mapped out several dozen available hosts from here to DC that we can use to mask our presence in the system. I haven&rsquo;t made contact with home-base yet, I want to run some diagnostics first. Need to make sure there&rsquo;s no key loggers or watchdogs on the system. I&rsquo;m not very good with digital countermeasures. Might be a good opportunity to bring Starr in.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Good, let&rsquo;s go with that. For now, you are Starr&rsquo;s only point of contact I don&rsquo;t want him to even catch sight of me. If at all possible I want to have the agents in this building to catch sight of him either. See what you can do about it. In the meantime, I&rsquo;m about to become a regular weekend customer of the Market Plaza restaurant. Maybe I can&rsquo;t get to know the boy. Tomorrow morning at 10 AM you have a meeting with the DA, I want you to pull out all the stops do the whole Ivy League thing. If you can, get in with the judge tomorrow and get that wiretap. We&rsquo;ll figure out how to get the family out of the apartment later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holland, you never told me what headquarters said other than that we were following the kid here. I mean, what&rsquo;s the play if we confirm him or at least suspect him? I mean we have to bring him in, right? What&rsquo;s that look like? Can we do the tests here at the university or do we take him all the way back to New York?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Hopefully it doesn&rsquo;t come to that, and if it does, we will do whatever headquarters tells us to. Now finish making this map thing. I need to call support to make sure everyone&rsquo;s ready. This place is friendly on the surface, but I have a feeling someone will be checking up on me soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What to you mean? I thought you said they didn&rsquo;t even bother to read your badge number.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Pera, do you know how many black FBI agents there are active right now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I donno know, 50?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Six with four more in the Academy right now, that&rsquo;s why I never use a badge from the same place we&rsquo;re visiting. But it will only be a matter of time before somebody mentions something and home-base needs to be ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not for the first time, Pera wondered why home-base even bothered recruiting someone like Holland. His race or his personality were problematic alone. Combined they seemed like a powder keg waiting to blow. He turned back to the terminal spent the next several hours finishing his network map. When he was done he got up and walked over to the little desk phone sitting on a chair at the end of the conference room. He pulled out his notebook and dialed the number written there.
The phone rang several times before a woman&rsquo;s voice answered, &ldquo;hello.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Jack there?&rdquo;
&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s not here right now. Who&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be Jane,&rdquo; he said in his most congenial manner. &ldquo;Jack has talked so much about you, I feel like I know you already. My name is Lawrence Durkle, I&rsquo;m a research professor from Caltech. Jack and I have been talking about what he might do after he graduates. I have a little opportunity for some paid research right here in Portland. I&rsquo;m in town for the next several weeks could you have him call me as soon as possible?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, really? That&rsquo;s great let me get something to write down your number with, thank you so much.&rdquo; All in all the day was turning out far better than he would&rsquo;ve anticipated. He couldn&rsquo;t help smiling to himself as he gave her the number to his pager.</p>
